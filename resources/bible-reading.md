The Bible is a library of 66 different books all written with a different meaning and purpose. We must try to understand the genre before we even read a single word.

## Narrative (Historical Books)

**Genesis, Exodus, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther**

These are theological histories—showing what God has done in real events. They highlight God's character and purposes, not just moral examples.

## Law

**Exodus–Deuteronomy**

These laws reveal God's covenant standards for Israel. Understand each in its covenant context, discerning what is fulfilled in Christ and what reflects God's enduring moral will.

## Poetry & Wisdom

**Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs**

Hebrew poetry uses imagery, emotion, and parallelism. Read poetically—seeking timeless truths and heart-level reflection, not literal guarantees.

## Prophecy

**Isaiah–Malachi**

The prophets were covenant messengers calling Israel back to faithfulness. Most spoke to their own times, though some pointed forward to Christ and God's redemptive plan.

## Gospels

**Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John**

These theological biographies proclaim who Jesus is and what He did. Read them as unified stories of redemption; notice each author's emphasis and the meaning of Jesus' words.

## Acts

Acts continues Luke's story, showing how the Holy Spirit empowered the early church. It describes what happened, not always what must happen. Look for principles of mission, unity, and bold witness.

## Epistles (Letters)

**Romans–Jude**

These are pastoral letters addressing real issues in real churches. Discover the timeless principles behind each instruction and bridge ancient context to modern life.

## Apocalyptic

**Daniel and Revelation**

This symbolic literature reveals God's ultimate victory through vivid images and visions. Focus on the big picture: God reigns, evil will be defeated, and His people will persevere.

## So How Should I Study the Bible?

**SOAP - Scripture | Observation | Application | Prayer**

### Scripture

Read it, re-read it, and read it some more and in different translations.

### Observation

When you read scripture you should have questions, what kind of questions should we ask?

- What have I read about God/Jesus/Holy Spirit?
- How are they acting, responding, speaking?
- What do I see about the other characters in the text?
- How are the disciples acting? The Israelites? Moses? David?
- Anything I do not understand or any other questions come up?

### Application

What are you going to do about what you just read?

### Prayer

Scripture Fed. Spirit Led. Worship Based Prayer. Praying through the Lord's prayer (Matt 6:9-13) in whatever text you are reading.

> **Reverence**: With an open Bible, the beginning point in prayer is to ask, "Who is God?" and "What does He reveal about Himself in this passage?" This sparks worship (reverence) in alignment with the focus, *"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."*
