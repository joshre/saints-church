### Why?

Creating intentional times of Bible study and disciple making for your family.

### Who Attends?

Everyone under your roof.

### Who Leads Family Church?

The husband is the head of the household and should lead this time with his family. (Eph 5:23-25)

### When?

When everyone is home. Usually the start or end of the day. Everyday.

### How Long Should It Take?

5-15 minutes.

### What Do You Do?

Pray, read scripture, discuss, review catechism, and worship.

----

Family church will look different for every family, because every family is different. Here are some basic principles for each portion and a simple roadmap.

## Roadmap

1. Catechism Review
2. Prayer
3. Bible Reading
4. Discussion
5. Prayer
6. Chorus of Worship Song

Take a few minutes before you start family church to have a gameplan and roadmap what you are going to do. A little preparation goes a long way. Be consistent with your roadmap. Once you find a flow that fits your family, keep running that same play.

### Catechism Review

Go over our church's catechism for the week. Usually, early in the week for young kids it's a "repeat after me" which turns to memorization by the end of the week.

### Prayer

An opening prayer that just settles our hearts and turns our attention to the Bible reading. Then an ending prayer to remind us of the important truths before we leave. Typically husband and wife split these prayers or maybe a child with the ending prayer.

### Bible Reading

How old are your children? If you have younger kids, a children's Bible might be best. And go one story at a time. If you need help on choosing a children's Bible, please reach out.

If it is just adults or older children, maybe work your way through a book of the Bible a chapter or section at a time. Like stated earlier, know your audience, the people in your home and meet their needs. This can also be an opportunity for wife to read or children to read.

### Discussion

Again we want to lead the discussion to be focused on the story/passage you are reading. Parents should work together to apply the passage concretely to your family's life.

Some sample questions to ask could be: "Do you understand what we just read?" "What was this story about?", "Did these people do the right thing?", or "Why did Jesus have to go to the cross?". The goal of the discussion is to reinforce Biblical truth and a Biblical worldview to the people in our home.

If your children are older or you are just adults the conversation might head to deeper questions and topics and that's great, and don't be afraid to say "I don't know, let's look that up". If you do say something like that, **follow through**.

### Worship

Sing a chorus or song of worship music with your family. This is not your audition for the worship team. This is a time to lead and show that we sing songs of praise and worship not just at church, but this is a normal thing to do. You sing in the shower, in the car, and I know you sing Rocky Top, so don't go quiet for the God of all creation.

> **A Note to Husbands Who Feel Discouraged, Unequipped, or Unsure**
>
> If you are a husband, God has equipped you to do this, because he gave you your wife and children. You can lead this for your family and your family needs you to lead this. It's time to give it your best shot and try.
>
> Since God has blessed you with the people in your life you can, by faith lead with expectation knowing that the Lord will meet you in these moments. Expect God to use His word, not because you are super amazing, but because He is faithful. So be obedient to His word (Deut 6:4-7) and he will be faithful to use you and your efforts.

> **A Note for Wives**
>
> You are doing a great job, and yet your husband needs to lead. This is not to minimize you, but this is an opportunity to follow God's design. It might seem uncomfortable or you might prefer to lead in this situation, but do not let your husband off the hook.
>
> Instead, would you encourage him and build him up? Remind him that he can lead in this way and trust God's design and plan.
