        <p>As a church we are confessional baptists. Before you click away or think "another baptist church?!" Let us explain.</p>
<h2>London Baptist Confession of Faith (1689)</h2>
        <p><strong>Confessional</strong> - We recognize the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith (1689) as a faithful summary of important Biblical teachings.</p>

        <p><strong>Baptist</strong> - We believe that those who actually profess repentance towards God, faith in, and obedience to, our Lord Jesus Christ are the only proper people for baptism. And we believe full water immersion is the way to do it.</p>

        <p>So we are not affiliated with any particular denomination, but we do attach ourselves to a centuries old way of interpreting the key points scripture.</p>

        <p>If you are not familiar with this confession of faith <a href="https://founders.org/library-book/1689-confession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here it is in full</a>. And if you would like to know some more specifics of what we believe as a church here is the Apostles Creed.</p>

        <h2>The Apostles' Creed</h2>
        
        <p>We believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.</p>

        <p>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic* Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.</p>

        <p class="text-sm italic text-stone-600 dark:text-stone-400">*When the creed says "catholic", it is referring to the universal church. It's affirming belief in the one, true, united Church — the global community of Christians — not any one denomination or specifically Roman Catholicism.</p>

        <h2>The New City Catechism</h2>

        <p>We also use the New City Catechism as a tool for doctrinal training and discipleship. If you are unfamiliar with catechisms they are a list of questions and answers around the core doctrines of the faith. Catechisms were written with at least three goals in mind. First, they were meant to clearly explain the gospel—what it is and what it's built on, like who God is, what it means to be human, the nature of sin, and other key doctrines from Scripture. Second, they aimed to teach all of this in a way that pushed back against the false teachings and cultural confusion of the time. And third, they had a more pastoral goal: to help shape a distinct community—a people who not only reflected Christ in their personal lives but also lived out his likeness together as the church.</p>

        <p>The New City Catechism pulls from Calvin's Geneva Catechism, the Westminster Shorter and Larger Catechisms, and especially the Heidelberg Catechism. It's designed to give people a taste of the depth and wisdom found in those historic texts, with the hope that it inspires them to explore the originals and keep growing through catechesis over the course of their lives.</p>
