about_us:
  title: "About Us"
  story: "Our church started in the fall of 2022 when a few families realized that their friendship was meant for more than just us. We started meeting weekly in a home and our kids quickly outgrew the 2 bedrooms they were sharing."
  growth: "We thought and prayed about doing the home church thing and starting another house church, but we felt like the community of people that God was leading us to was not ready for that kind of split. So one of our elders opened up his business office for us to meet in. We still meet there weekly, and guess what? There's room for you."
  family_church:
    title: "Family Church"
    description: "In family church we gather all of our church together to review our weekly catechism, a teaching on that catechism at an age appropriate level, then spend some time worshipping all together as a community."
    children: "Our Sunday children's program is for babies to about 10. We believe that our children can handle \"adult church\" and we encourage you as a parent to make the decision when your child is ready to sit in service with you."

beliefs:
  title: "What We Believe"
  intro: "As a church we are confessional baptists. Before you click away or think 'another baptist church?!' Let us explain."
  content_html: |
    <p>We love the London Baptist Confession of Faith written in 1689. It's a document that articulates what we see taught in scripture.</p>

    <p>When we say we are "confessional" we mean that we gladly and publicly confess what we believe the Bible teaches about God, salvation, the church, and Christian living. We find great wisdom in learning from those who have gone before us.</p>

    <p><strong>What makes us different from other baptists?</strong></p>

    <p>We believe in the sovereignty of God in salvation (often called the doctrines of grace or "Calvinism"). We believe that God chooses who will be saved, and that salvation is entirely by grace through faith - not by human decision or effort.</p>

    <p>We practice covenant baptism by immersion for believers only. We do not baptize infants, but wait until a person can make a credible profession of faith.</p>

    <p>We celebrate the Lord's Supper weekly as a church family, believing it to be a means of grace and a foretaste of the great wedding feast to come.</p>

    <p><strong>Our approach to ministry:</strong></p>

    <p>We are committed to expository preaching - working through books of the Bible verse by verse rather than topical sermons.</p>

    <p>We believe in plurality of elders and congregational government. Major decisions are made together as a church body.</p>

    <p>We practice church discipline with love and gentleness, always with the goal of restoration and the purity of the church.</p>

    <p><strong>Family integrated worship:</strong></p>

    <p>We believe children are a blessing and should be included in worship. We don't have separate children's church during the main service, though we do provide nursery for the very young.</p>

    <p>We use catechisms to teach our children the fundamental truths of the faith in an age-appropriate way.</p>

pastor_letter:
  title: "A Letter from Our Pastor"
  pastor_name: "Pastor Nate Ellis"

    <p>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>If you've found your way to our website, chances are you're looking for a church home, or at least curious about what we're about. Let me save you some time - we're not trying to be the biggest, the flashiest, or the most entertaining church in Knoxville.</p>

    <p>What we are trying to be is faithful.</p>

    <p>Faithful to God's Word. Faithful to the gospel. Faithful to one another as a church family.</p>

    <p><strong>Who we are:</strong></p>

    <p>We're a small congregation that started meeting in 2022. Most of us are young families with kids who make noise during the service (and we're okay with that). We meet in an elder's business office because that's what we can afford, and honestly, it suits us just fine.</p>

    <p>We're Reformed Baptists, which means we believe in the sovereignty of God in salvation and the authority of Scripture in all matters of faith and practice. We use the London Baptist Confession of Faith (1689) as our doctrinal standard.</p>

    <p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>

    <p>Our worship is simple and Word-centered. We sing psalms, hymns, and some modern worship songs (with acoustic guitar accompaniment), we pray together, we celebrate the Lord's Supper weekly, and we preach through books of the Bible verse by verse.</p>

    <p>Don't expect a show - expect to meet with God through His Word and with His people in genuine fellowship.</p>

    <p><strong>Our heart:</strong></p>

    <p>We believe the local church should be a family. We know each other's names, we eat in each other's homes, we bear each other's burdens, and we celebrate each other's joys.</p>

    <p>We're not perfect - we're sinners saved by grace, learning to love God and each other better. But we're committed to growing together in Christ.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for a church that takes God's Word seriously, values authentic community, and isn't afraid to be small in order to be faithful, we'd love to have you visit.</p>

    <p><strong>Come as you are:</strong></p>

    <p>Whether you're a longtime believer or just curious about Christianity, whether you're single or married, young or old, we'd be honored to have you join us on Sunday morning.</p>

    <p>In Christ,<br>Pastor Nate Ellis</p>
