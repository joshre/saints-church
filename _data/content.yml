about_us:
  title: "About Us"
  story: "Our church started in the fall of 2022 when a few families realized that their friendship was meant for more than just us. We started meeting weekly in a home and our kids quickly outgrew the 2 bedrooms they were sharing."
  growth: "We thought and prayed about doing the home church thing and starting another house church, but we felt like the community of people that God was leading us to was not ready for that kind of split. So one of our elders opened up his business office for us to meet in. We still meet there weekly, and guess what? There's room for you."
  family_church:
    title: "Family Church"
    description: "In family church we gather our whole church together to review our weekly catechism, a teaching on that catechism at an age appropriate level, then spend some time worshipping all together as a community."
    children: "Our Sunday children's program is for babies to about 10. We believe that our children can handle \"adult church\" and we encourage you as a parent to make the decision when your child is ready to sit in service with you."

  title: "What We Believe"
  intro: "As a church we are confessional baptists. Before you click away or think 'another baptist church?!' Let us explain."
  content_html: |
    <p>We love the London Baptist Confession of Faith written in 1689. It's a document that articulates what we see taught in scripture.</p>

    <p>When we say we are "confessional" we mean that we gladly and publicly confess what we believe the Bible teaches about God, salvation, the church, and Christian living. We find great wisdom in learning from those who have gone before us.</p>

    <h3>What makes us "baptists"?</h3>

    <p>We believe in the sovereignty of God in salvation. We believe that God chooses who will be saved, and that salvation is entirely by grace through faith - not by human decision or effort.</p>

    <p>We practice covenant baptism by immersion for believers only. We do not baptize infants, but wait until a person can make a credible profession of faith.</p>

    <p>We celebrate the Lord's Supper weekly as a church family, believing it to be a means of grace and a foretaste of the great wedding feast to come.</p>

    <h3>Our approach to ministry</h3>

    <p>We are committed to expository preaching - working through books of the Bible verse by verse rather than topical sermons.</p>

    <p>We believe in plurality of elders and congregational government. Major decisions are made together as a church body.</p>

    <p>We practice church discipline with love and gentleness, always with the goal of restoration and the purity of the church.</p>

    <h3>Family integrated worship</h3>

    <p>We believe children are a blessing and should be included in worship. We don't have separate children's church during the main service, though we do provide nursery for the very young.</p>

    <p>We use catechisms to teach our children the fundamental truths of the faith in an age-appropriate way.</p>

pastor_letter:
  title: "A Letter from Our Pastor"
  pastor_name: "Pastor Nate Ellis"
  content_html: |
    <p>Hey there! My name is Nate Ellis and I serve as lead pastor here at Saints Church. If you've found yourself on our website and this letter, chances are you're probably looking for a new church or you're curious about who we are and what we're about. So let me share some of that with you!</p>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>

    <p>We are a church that is trying to be as intentional with what God has given us. That starts with the way we treat the Word of God and goes all the way down to the facility we meet at. We started meeting as a congregation in September of 2022 in a home and moved to the facility we meet at now in June of 2024.</p>

    <p>We are a smaller congregation with a heavy emphasis on the Word and Work of Jesus Christ. As well as community, family, service to one another and the community around us. We're not perfect - we're sinners saved by grace, learning to love God and each other better. But we're committed to growing together in Christ.</p>

    <h2>What we're about</h2>

    <p>Our mission as a church is to be Jesus followers who gather and go. Gathering was incredibly important to the early church and we find it to be incredibly important now. That's why we make time every Sunday to fellowship. That's why we make time in the week to gather (in many different ways) to stay connected. We also want to go into the world and make disciples, just as Jesus commands us, and we believe that starts in your home. Go wherever God has placed you. And God has placed you in an apartment with roommates, as a husband or wife, father, mother, or grandparent. Wherever God has placed you, that's where God wants you to make disciples.</p>

    <p>Our church is made up of a lot of young families, so our Sunday morning rhythm reflects that. We make time to worship together as a church family with our kiddos. It's kind of crazy, but we're alright with that because our children need to see the people of God worship the God of all creation. We also have a separate space for kids during Sunday morning to be cared for by a team of church members, continue to learn our catechism and Bible story for the week, and of course have fun! This ministry is provided for infants to about age 10. We really leave that up to the parent to decide, but we believe older children can participate and bring value to our church body.</p>

    <p>Worship through song on Sunday mornings is simple on purpose. We sing songs of worship that direct us to our Lord, Jesus Christ. Usually with an acoustic guitar and keyboard.</p>

    <p>On Sunday mornings, we teach verse by verse each week through a book of the Bible. We also pray scripture, usually the Psalms. So bring your Bible and get ready to use it. Feel free to check out our Sunday sermon archive to get a taste of the weekly preaching.</p>

    <p>Whether it be our church or another, we pray that God would lead you to a church that preaches the word of God and continually preaches the Gospel of Jesus Christ. That is the only message that saves.</p>

    <p>God bless!<br>Nate Ellis</p>
