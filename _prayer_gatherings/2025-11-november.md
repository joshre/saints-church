# The God Who Sees

## Psalm 9:10-11

**10** And those who know your name put their trust in you,
for you, O Lord, have not forsaken those who seek you.

**11** Sing praises to the Lord, who sits enthroned in Zion!
Tell among the peoples his deeds!

## Genesis 16:13

**13** So she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, "You are a God of seeing," for she said, "Truly here I have seen him who looks after me."

## Psalm 139:7-12

**7** Where shall I go from your Spirit?
Or where shall I flee from your presence?

**8** If I ascend to heaven, you are there!
If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there!

**9** If I take the wings of the morning
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,

**10** even there your hand shall lead me,
and your right hand shall hold me.

**11** If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me,
and the light about me be night,"

**12** even the darkness is not dark to you;
the night is bright as the day,
for darkness is as light with you.
