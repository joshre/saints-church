        <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-stone-600 sm:text-xl/8 dark:text-stone-300 child ![--delay:0.35s]">The supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same night he was betrayed. It is to be observed in his churches to the end of the age as a perpetual remembrance and display of the sacrifice of himself in his death.</p>
        <p class="mt-6 text-sm text-stone-700 sm:text-base/7 dark:text-stone-400 child ![--delay:0.45s]">In this ordinance Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor is any real sacrifice made at all for remission of sin of the living or the dead. It is only a memorial of the one offering Christ made of himself on the cross once for all.</p>
        <p class="mt-6 text-sm text-stone-700 sm:text-base/7 dark:text-stone-400 child ![--delay:0.55s]">Practically, we partake of the Lord's Supper weekly. And any Christian who is not under discipline from another church may participate.</p>

        <p class="mt-6 text-sm text-stone-700 sm:text-base/7 dark:text-stone-400 child ![--delay:0.75s]">Eating with fellow believers as well as neighbors. All throughout the scriptures we see Jesus having meals with people. From the tax collector to the prostitute Jesus would welcome all to his table. We try our best to welcome our neighbors and our friends into our homes or our favorite restaurants, and even your buddy who works for the IRS.</p>
