## Transcription

This morning let's turn to John chapter 11 verse 45.

We'll just read our pericope as those fancier than I call it.

The section of scripture that we're studying and reading is a pericope.

So that is a fun word.

John 11, 45 through 12, 8.

And while you're turning there, just reminding you to make sure you're checking in Slack.

There's a few notifications and a few things coming up.

We announced our church-wide camping trip and that will be over a Sunday.

And so I know it was set on the message and thanks to Kayla for getting all that set up and being our liaison and point person for that.

But especially because it is over a Sunday and it is also for those who care, it's a very special Saturday.

It's the third Saturday in October.

I don't even say anymore.

Anyways.

Since it is a Sunday, if finances are tight or you need help in that arena, please reach out to us.

The last thing we want to do is to change the location on a Sunday.

And then because of finances, you not be able to join us.

That's all I'll say.

And if you don't think it's fun, get my shirt.

Yeah.

I know.

Look, there's bears, there's fish, there's fish and mountains and sun.

And sales.

And merch.

There's a lot of merch.

Both Spence and Josh are poster boys this weekend.

Anyways.

There's no poster.

Yeah.

If there were, Kayla would have eaten already.

Beef tallow.

I did change my moisturizer this week.

Because I was scared.

Not going to lie.

So we've got that coming up.

And then be sure to check on the Midweek channel for the dates.

We've made a couple changes to our typical flow the last couple months.

And so our prayer and worship gathering is the first week of April.

And so just make sure you have that in your calendar and you're checking those dates.

Yes.

John 11, 45 through 12, 8.

If somebody wants to read that for us.

I can.

I can.

Alright.

I can.

Okay.

Okay.

Thank you.

And we cut it right after they had been raised.

Get told what Jesus did.

And what do they do?

They do not rejoice that this must be the Messiah.

Look at all these signs he's doing.

This man surely has to be from God.

This man surely has to be from God.

That's not their response.

They think, How is this going to negatively affect us?

How is this going to negatively impact us?

How is this going to negatively impact us?

You see, and the problem here You see, and the problem here is that they are not starting with the right question.

They are the religious leaders.

So you think if they hear and see So you think if they hear and see the signs that Jesus was performing the signs that Jesus was performing shouldn't the question be shouldn't the question be What are we about to do?

Is this the Messiah?

This has to be the Messiah.

No one else is doing miracles like this.

That would be the right first question.

But their first question, the Pharisees first question, What is right, but what is right for them?

What is right, but what is right for them?

If we let him go on like this, they say, If we let him go on like this, they say, everyone will believe in him and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.

It would be terrible if our nation or our identity were taken away.

It would be equally as bad if their land, their property were taken from them.

What are we going to do?

They're going to take our land and they're going to take our nation.

They could completely lose their status and their acceptance from the Romans if they honor the Messiah, if they acknowledge the Messiah.

Now, I'm probably speaking a little more harshly about the Pharisees than I should be because we do the same thing all the time.

We do what's convenient.

We do what's most expedient.

What's easiest.

What's most logical.

This is sort of the question and sort of the main idea I want us to be thinking of as we're going through this text and leaving here this morning is will you do what is right or what is easiest?

Because often times those two are at conflict.

The Jews wanted to prevent Jesus from causing a stir among the people so that they don't lose their positions of power.

Keeping that position of power was the priority.

And getting rid of Jesus was the easiest thing.

Keeping their position was what was easiest not what was right.

So, one of the leaders proposed a solution, verse 49, but one of them Caiaphas, who was high priest at here, said to them, you know nothing at all nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.

So the high priest speaks and he essentially is saying it's better for Jesus to die rather than all of us lose everything.

Caiaphas chose to do the expedient thing.

What was the easiest decision?

Just get rid of Jesus.

That solves all of our problems.

If we get rid of this Jesus guy then we can keep carrying on, keep doing our own thing.

But if we acknowledge he is the Messiah, it's going to mess everything up for us.

Then John adds his own sort of commentary in the midst of this story.

Right?

He's verse 51.

So John tells us that the high priest prophesied without knowing it, that Jesus would die for the people, but not just those among the Jews who would believe, but all his people who are scattered abroad.

So with the high priest's blessing plans for Jesus execution moved into high gear and because of those plans, Jesus left Bethany.

Verse 53.

So from that day on they made plans to put him to death.

Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there to the region near the wilderness to a town called Ephraim and there he stayed with the disciples.

So a question we could ask is why did Jesus not walk, or why did Jesus walk in private and not openly?

So that no human court or plan could force Jesus to the cross.

Jesus was not forced to the cross by humanly force.

He willingly went to the cross.

Jesus was not forced to the cross.

Jesus willingly took up the cross.

That's why he escapes.

That's why he flees to a town of Ephraim, which is about 12 miles outside of Jerusalem.

Because Jesus will choose and will of his own accord go to the cross.

Not be forced to the cross on from a human's perspective or a human's challenging.

So Jesus is in this town far enough to be safe for the time being and close enough to make it back into town for Passover.

Which we turn the page in Chapter 12 if you actually do.

Six days before Passover 12 verse 1, Jesus therefore came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.

Jesus is back in town as Passover was about to start.

And just as we turn the page into this Chapter 12, we have now entered into the beginning of the end.

This is the if you remember way back when we started John, it's all of Jesus' sort of ministry publicly happened in the first 11 chapters and now we turn the page to this final week or so.

The actual exact timeline is up for debate depending on which Gospel you read.

But that's another question to answer for another time and not pressing so we carry on.

But now we will see about the last week of Jesus' life and his ministry to his disciples and his loved ones.

Six days before Passover, Jesus therefore came to Bethany where Lazarus was raised, was whom Jesus had raised from the dead, verse 2.

So they gave a dinner for him there, Martha served and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at the table.

Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from purinard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair.

The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

Culturally and at this time touching feet and sandals was the job for the lowest of the low.

It was a job for slaves and a nasty job at that.

If you remember, John the Baptist declared in John 1 that he was not even worthy to untie Jesus' sandals.

And John the Baptist was saying he was unworthy to even be a disciple of Jesus.

Right?

Like this untying sandals and dealing with feet was a job for the lowest of the low in the societal class.

And yet here we see Mary pour out this expensive perfume and use her hair to wipe Jesus' feet.

What an extravagant act.

Complete adoration and love for Jesus.

And I guess this leads me to a question what could you and I possibly do that would be too extravagant in honoring Jesus?

Too extravagant in praising him.

Too extravagant in giving him glory.

I'm sure some of you are living it.

Some of you remember for some of us long, long times ago, for some of us more recently, when you first started dating or your first, the first signs of engagement and you just, you just can't not talk to your, to your loved one.

It's like every waking moment you have to be on the phone with them.

You have to it's the last thing you do before like, before your head hits the pillow your, your good night every moment you're just sort of encapsulated and just so they call it puppy love.

Just, you just complete adoration just complete, I just can't, I can't let you go.

Like just, just never stop dating, am I right?

Yep, yep, that's right.

But why?

Because we you love each other and you would just you can't do anything to not be together.

And if we love Christ it is appropriate to love him extravagantly.

For he is worthy of extravagant love and praise and worship and some of us we even have a hard time lifting our hands in worship.

But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, he was about to betray him said, why was this oymah not sold for three hundred nary and given to the poor?

He said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief and having charge of the money bag he used it to help himself to what was put into it.

So Judas sees this extravagant offering, this extravagant pouring out of Mary.

And what's his response?

We could have given this to the poor!

This oymah could have been sold for three hundred nary and given to the poor.

A denarii was about a day's wage and so three hundred denarii that's about a year's wage.

Quote-unquote wasted in Judas's mind on Jesus.

And then again John sort of gives us this commentary on this and his and he the writer inserts himself into the story.

And I actually find these assertions into the story to be incredibly authentic and also very relatable.

John is writing of course after all of these things have happened and he's recounting this story and he remembers this part and he can't help himself but say he said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief and having charge of the money bag he used it to help himself to what was put into it.

So we see John's complete disdain for Judas.

And of course he sees how Judas sold out Jesus.

And he's like I just I can't stand this guy.

It's like just his complete he inserts like the story would be fine without it.

We would see what Judas is going to do and of course if you come back to the scripture time and time and time again we would understand and have our own sort of ick or feelings about Judas but he puts it in the text and I just completely relate to it.

It's like if somebody brings up the Lakers to me I just just disgusted.

Just can't stand the brand.

Just can't stand the brand.

Can't stand the team.

Thank you.

For some of us we feel that way about Alabama football.

We feel that way and notice how I'm not talking about the people.

I'm talking about the sport or the brand because well he's not here today so I can say whatever I want.

Because some of us and Connor if you're listening to this yeah that's right.

The only crimson red I need is the blood of my savior.

Anyways.

Anyways.

Anyways.

Anyways.

So I can somewhat relate to John in that aspect.

But anyways John has the now the understanding and the hindsight to see what was really happening with the motives of Judas.

He was going to betray Jesus and he wanted the money from the perfume not for the poor but because he was a thief.

Verse 7.

Jesus said, Leave her alone so that she may keep it for the day of my burial.

For the poor you will always have with you.

But you do not always have me.

And Jesus' words here might seem harsh but he was not saying the poor should be ignored.

Rather he was saying the opportunity to serve him in a tangible way would not last long.

While ministry to the poor would always be in demand.

I heard a story this week of a man who served in the inner cities in Ohio.

And this sort of verse here, these words of Jesus became sort of his motivation.

And the person who was telling the story was talking about how he said, why?

Like that seems kind of like demotivating.

The poor you will always have with you.

And here's this man serving in the inner cities.

And he said, Because I've seen the truth of it.

In my work, we'll get four people off the streets and then four more will come back in.

There will always be poor to serve.

And he used that as his motivation to keep serving.

That the poor will always be among us.

And again, these words are not harsh or that the poor should be ignored.

And you see something that Jesus misunderstood was Mary's heart.

He could see her heart.

And it's almost as if Jesus is giving the justification for Mary's actions.

It's like Mary was saying in this demonstration.

It's like Mary was saying, I wanted to save this for Jesus' burial, but why wait?

I am going to give this gift now.

I can minister to the poor tomorrow and the days to follow, but I will not have every day to show my affection for Jesus.

See, she knew the buzz.

She knew that the Pharisees were looking for Jesus.

That Jesus was out in Ephraim and he was coming back into town.

And she knew that people were trying to kill Jesus.

And so she also knew Jesus' purpose.

She knew that Jesus was going to die, that he was going to be the son of man, was going to be lifted up.

She knew all these words of Jesus.

And she knew Jesus' purpose.

She knew.

And so she took this moment to show her affection and love for Jesus.

But do you know who should have been there pouring out her perfume?

Pouring out their perfume on Jesus' feet?

Caiaphas, the high priest.

He should have been at Jesus' feet saying, we have seen your signs.

We know who you are.

You are the Messiah.

We don't care who comes for us.

We don't care what we will face.

You are Jesus, the son of God.

And you deserve all praise and adoration.

Come hell or high water I will praise you.

Whatever it costs, whatever inconvenience it is to me.

Whatever happens with Rome.

If I die, I die.

If I perish, I perish.

I will praise you.

Why?

Because that's the right thing to do.

Not the easy thing to do.

I'm reminded of our Christian brothers who are in Syria right now.

Literally hundreds if not thousands of Christians are being killed because they proclaim the name of Jesus.

Being beaten.

Families being torn apart.

It's absolutely brutal what's happening to them.

Our brothers and sisters.

We do not know them by name.

We do not speak.

We cannot speak their language.

But we will see them in eternity.

Our brothers and sisters through the blood of Jesus Christ and they are being martyred and not just in Syria but all over the world.

And what a gift we have.

To be in this nation.

Land of the free home of the brave.

Who have set up our nation, our constitution with religious liberty in mind.

Why?

Because they themselves were persecuted for their beliefs.

And they fled to America.

And we can look at what happens around the world and see the persecution of believers.

And feeling incredible gratitude and incredible thankfulness for our abilities and freedoms.

But often times what we don't see or what we don't realize is that our own beliefs and beliefs is that our own freedoms are trapped in a space on Sundays.

That we leave our faith here in public or here in private in a safe space.

We've created, rightfully so, the church, a safe space to be a believer.

But it is incredibly safe for us to be to proclaim the name of Jesus outside of these walls on a Sunday or outside of our homes.

And sometimes we do what's easiest by not engaging in certain conversations at work.

By not engaging with in the public square where people take our Lord's name in vain or are just flat out rude or speak illy of Christians and of believers.

And we choose what's easy and staying silent.

And not that we have to be the person on the street corner with a sign that says Jesus loves you.

But we do have opportunities day by day to stand up.

And not for the protection of God.

God doesn't need our protection.

But I'm reminded of Jesus if you I guess I'm right here.

I could just turn the page and say his words for verbatim.

Chapter 11.

Verse 9.

Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

If anyone walks in the day he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world.

But if anyone walks in the night he stumbles because the light is not in him.

Jesus was referencing the works that he was doing and his protection being in the light doing his father's work.

If we do our father's work we will surely be protected.

Even unto death because again there is more for us than this Earth.

We have eternity.

And so even if we die great.

We get to start forever.

It's easy to just give into the world and culture around us.

It's easy to do what is most expedient or it's most convenient versus doing what is right.

And Mary understood what Mary understood and remembered was Jesus raising her brother from the dead.

She experienced the extravagant grace given to her by Jesus by his power and raising her brother from the dead.

And there was nothing that she could do to thank him enough.

But she did what she could extravagantly.

There was nothing she could do to thank Jesus enough.

There was nothing she could do.

But she did what she could extravagantly.

For you and for me through Jesus's life, death and resurrection we experience his extravagant love for us through belief that he is the Messiah, the true son of God.

We experience his extravagant love for us.

There is nothing we can do to thank him enough.

But we can praise him extravagantly.

We can praise him extravagantly.

Not just in worship through song but our whole lives as worship to Jesus poured out in adoration and affection and love for God who loved us first.

And what happens when we do that?

It tells us verse 3 that the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

The world your world your day to day gets to experience the love the aroma the presence of a loving Savior when we pour out our praise and adoration extravagantly.

Let us be peace with our Lord and let us be let us be people who do not hold back in the things of God because we're worried about being embarrassed because we're worried about maybe not saying something exactly right because we're worried about what other people are going to think of us what's going to happen with our position with our whatever let our lives be poured out to our Savior who has done more than enough and we cannot thank him enough but we do what we can exceedingly not for our own gain not for our own glory but because he's worthy.

Would you pray with me?

Jesus we thank you for who you are we thank you that we have the freedoms we have have the liberties that we have in this country in this nation but more importantly through you and Lord we're not looking for persecution but we are asking that through your Spirit's power inside of us that we would do what we can to help you would do what is right and it is right to glorify you in everything that we do it is right to live a life that praises you and so Jesus help us to do that give us boldness when needed give us courage when needed give us strength when needed give us peace when needed we thank you that you are with us you are always with us and you are so good to us we love you and we praise you and we worship you and it's in Jesus name everyone said Amen
