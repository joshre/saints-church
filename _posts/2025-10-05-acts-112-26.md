## Transcription

What do you do when you have to wait?

When you have to wait for something?

Like somebody reaches out to you and they're like, hey I've got something to tell you, but you gotta wait.

Like what fills your heart?

Is there anxiousness?

Is there excitement?

I guess depending on the person.

Is there...

They're like, do you start playing worst-case scenario?

Do you...like what goes on in your head?

Like some of you guys are like, when are we gonna get more information about this camping trip that we're going on?

And I said wait.

And we see here what the disciples did and were doing when Jesus told them to wait.

Right?

Like Jesus, He says, go to Jerusalem and wait.

And then my Spirit is gonna come.

And then you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the ends of the earth.

And so the question for us today is, how do we wait?

What decisions do we make as we wait?

Wait.

I've got a bunch of different points here that I'm going to sprinkle throughout.

They'll be glittered throughout.

And then I've got a list for you at the end.

So if you're the note-taking type and you're like, oh I missed it.

Or was that it?

I got you on the end.

Don't worry.

Okay, verse 12.

Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day journey away.

So what's the first thing we see from the disciples, from the apostles?

They obeyed Jesus.

He told them to go to Jerusalem.

And what did they do?

They went to Jerusalem.

They didn't forget Jesus' sermon or His instructions after He preached it, after He taught it, as some of us might tend to do.

The preacher says something, and then you forget it.

But we don't have to go there right now.

But they actually did what He said.

Can we call ourselves Christians if we do not do what our Lord and Savior tells us to do?

Just a question to warm us up this morning.

Verse 13.

Okay, so they get to where they were staying, and what do they do?

With one accord, we're devoting themselves to prayer.

They were united together and praying.

Just like think back through the stories of the Gospels that you know.

And how often were the disciples and apostles just kind of like in competition with one another?

They were even racing to Jesus to see Him, if He was actually in the grave or out of the grave.

And John gives us that account at the end of his Gospel where he notes that He beat Peter in a foot race.

Like we can see all throughout the Scriptures, they're just kind of like, almost, it seems like they're competing for Jesus' attention.

They're competing for, they want to be the best disciple.

And yet, how do we see them after Jesus ascends?

They are together with one accord.

They were unified.

They were together with one mind and one purpose, in fellowship with one another.

There was unity amongst these.

And there wasn't just unity, but they found themselves in prayer.

The men and women together in prayer.

It's beautiful.

We don't have to look too far in the Gospels and in Acts to see prayer.

To see the people together praying.

Why?

Because they always saw Jesus praying, probably.

Jesus didn't tell them.

He said, go to Jerusalem and wait.

He didn't tell them, hey, while you're waiting, I want you guys to really work on your prayer together.

He didn't give them that instruction.

They just did it.

That was their response.

And remember, when Jesus tore up the temple and He quotes a prophecy in Isaiah, and He says to the chief priests, this is Jesus, my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations.

Jesus desires that His people are praying people.

Jesus desires that His people are praying people.

Why do we have a prayer gathering every month?

Not so we can have something else on the calendar.

Not so we can have something else to do.

But because the Scriptures tell us, the disciples model for us prayer.

That's why we gather monthly to specifically come together and pray.

Hopefully that's not the only time we're praying.

Hopefully that's not the only time you're praying.

Hopefully prayer is trickled into your house.

Hopefully prayer is something that you do with yourself, with your spouse, with your families.

The only time the people in your house should hear you praying is not just with meals.

If that's it, may the Lord convict you.

May we be praying together.

Together, may you be praying with your spouse.

And if that's uncomfortable for you, I don't care.

We're quickly going to see here in these next few verses how prayer was consistent in the lives of the disciples and in the life of the early church.

And if our lives don't match that, again, I'm not questioning your salvation.

That's not what this is about.

But they watched Jesus pray frequently.

The disciples prayed frequently.

How about you?

Also, a quick note here.

We see Mary, the mother of Jesus, mentioned along with the other disciples.

She didn't have this super special role where she wasn't separated from the other believers.

She, in fact, believed what the angel Gabriel told her before the Spirit came upon her and she became pregnant with Jesus.

She believed that and she saw witness to her son say and do the things that the angel told her he was going to do.

And what did she do?

She put her faith in her Lord and Savior and he just so happened to be her son.

She just so happened to give birth to him.

Verse 15.

In those days, Peter stood up among the brothers.

The company of persons was in all about 120 and said, Brothers, the Scriptures had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas.

So at one point in these ten days, Peter stands up and says, The Scripture has to be fulfilled.

So what else do we see the disciples doing?

They're in the Word.

Obviously they didn't have it bound beautifully like we do now.

But they turn to the Scriptures.

And Peter's words show some wisdom that we don't typically see in the Gospel stories that we don't usually see before Jesus ascended.

And Peter here notes and says like that Judas did not spoil God's plan.

That the Scriptures had to be fulfilled.

And this is something that wise and mature and discerning disciples can see in the aftermath of evil.

That even in the midst of evil the Lord works and has a plan. we've seen that in our nation we've seen that I mean truthfully we've even seen it in our city just this last week there was a college gathering with worship and the gospel was proclaimed and there was like 500 baptisms at UT in the midst of what our world has been going through the last few weeks we could list the tragedies we could list the horrendous things happening in our world and yet the gospel is being advanced and as believers we can see that the Lord works in the midst of evil and our sovereign God always has a plan here we also see something very cool we see Peter explicitly saying the scriptures are from God what does he say the scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas so Peter attributes David's words that he that well he attributes them to Judas but the words that David spoke came through the spirit David's words were not random in fact they were the Holy Spirit spoke them beforehand by the mouth of David if you are a squeamish person or you don't like blood or bodily injury right now might be a good time to use the restroom Judas who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus for he was numbered among them and was allotted his share in this ministry now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out yummy and it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that the field was called in their own language so if we take this text and what Matthew in Matthew's gospel he'll tell us in chapter 27 Judas after selling out Jesus he was filled with regret and guilt and he goes back to the Pharisees and he throws the 30 silver coins that they gave him for selling out Jesus he gives them back to the Pharisees he throws them back to the Pharisees and then Judas goes and proceeds to hang himself and then he at some point in that process he fell from wherever he hung himself some believe it to be on a cliff which is why he burst open in the middle and his bowels gushed out nasty anyways the Pharisees they did not want this blood money and so what they did was they took that money to where Judas died and they bought the field and so Luke gives us that to say where why it's called the field of blood now Peter says verse 24 it is written in the book of Psalms may his camp become desolate and let there be no one to dwell in it and let another take his office so Peter quotes the Psalms of David this first one here is from Psalm 69 I believe it's verse 8 then let another take his office is from Psalm 109 and the actual verse is slipping my mind and some scholars attribute these Psalms to be linked to 1 Samuel chapters 21 through 22 where David is betrayed by a man and through all of that David was being chased by King Saul and David was getting away and this guy tells King Saul where David was and David is hiding and all these things and Saul proceeds to kill a ton of people who did not need to be killed and so they wanted to so then some scholars believe that these Psalms are linked to that story in 1 Samuel 21 and 22 and so David wanted his betrayer to be empty and fruitless and another person to take his office because the person who sold out David was he was worked within the king's quarters anyways fun context there anyways Peter believes that what he is about to do is the will of God and Peter desires to do God's will and replace Judas who betrayed Jesus so that's why he's quoting these Psalms and says hey look at these Psalms I think we need to replace Judas because he's bye bye bye verse 21 so one of the men who had accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection if if if a man saw with his eyes it would have been held up specifically within court and so one of these men seeing Jesus resurrected yeah we we've been with him since his baptism we heard a loud voice this is my son whom I love in which I'm well pleased and then we also saw him die and then we saw him rise again and actually we saw him ascend to heaven like we need like I saw it with my own eyes you cannot take this this what I've seen away from me incredibly important and so then they put forward these two guys Joseph called Barsabbas who was also called Justice and Matthias and they prayed and said you Lord who know the hearts of all show which one of these two you have chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place okay so when they prayed oh look at that they they prayed you Lord who know the hearts of all show which one of these two you have chosen to take Judas place their goal was not to do their will but his kingdom come his will be done on earth as it is in heaven and they cast lots for them and the lot fell on Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles so some might think that's kind of crazy they were casting lots the equivalent would be flipping a coin right some might think that's kind of crazy and to you I would say how many times have you made emotional and irrational decisions this almost seems like a better alternative if you ask me at any rate Proverbs 16 33 tells us the lot is cast into the lap but it's every decision is from the Lord so the Old Testament thinking here would be the Lord knows which side of the coin is going to flip and so we're just going to leave it up to that and then let the chips fall where they may that was kind of the thinking the understanding by casting lots and Matthias was chosen and there might be some Old Testament prophecy here being fulfilled with the placing of the 12th apostle so we can equate the 12 apostles right to the 12 tribes of Israel and in Ezekiel we get this prophecy Ezekiel 36 starting at verse 24 I will take you from the nations and gather you from all countries and will bring you into your own land I will sprinkle clean water on you and you shall be clean from all your uncleanliness and from all your idols I will cleanse you and I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will put within you and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh be my people and I will be your God this prophecy continues into chapter 37 and the word of the Lord continues to come to Ezekiel and he writes how God will bring back together the tribes of Judah and tribes of Israel let me quickly just catch you up the 12 tribes had split up at this point so Judah was two and then the other ten were over here and so Ezekiel is saying I'm going to bring you back together bring you into one body and the prophecy continues they will have one shepherd and everlasting covenant of peace with them what does all this mean 12 tribes and the 12 apostles must be all together for the new heart right and new spirit you'll put verse 27 here on the screen I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and carefully to obey my rules it's the spirit who does that inside of us not our own works not our own might not our own strength that's another sermon for another time so Peter's actions here of placing a 12th apostle could be fulfilling this Old Testament prophecy and you see some argue that Peter was stepping out of line and that Jesus would eventually appoint his 12th apostle in Paul later on in Acts which I mean who knows Paul never says like Matthias he was he took my spot or like he doesn't reject Matthias in any of his letters and you know since we're on this topic Revelation 21 14 tells us that each of the 12 foundations of the new Jerusalem has the name of one of the 12 apostles of the lamb on it and so when we get to heaven we'll see if Peter was right or if he was wrong we'll be able to see in that new Jerusalem like is that 12th apostle was it Paul or was Matthias who knows so an interesting story here and there's so much we can take away so much we can see so much we can look at and in this waiting time these 10 days from Christ's ascension to the falling of the spirit at Pentecost which leads us to the question for this morning is how can we make godly decisions how can we make godly decisions and before you can even do that we need to look at before a decision was ever made the disciples what did they do before a decision was ever made to get to Matthias what did the disciples do well first they obeyed that's a good place to start Jesus told them go to Jerusalem and wait and then they obeyed what else did they do they were in unity and fellowship they spent time with one another they were united okay Jesus told us to go and wait let's go wait and they waited all together what did they do to fill their time they prayed they were in prayer together not only did they pray but they were in the scriptures right Peter calls out two different psalms whether from his memory or from time in the temple they were in the scriptures together why because they wanted to do God's will they desperately wanted to be obedient to the Lord they wanted to do God's will they also used common sense right like they're about to name this 12th apostle and they're like hmm how should we do this should there be some diversity some equity and inclusion was that there no they were like okay Jesus we're all here we've all been here from the beginning hey who else has been here from the beginning who else has been here from the oh yeah that's a good idea and then which one of you guys who saw Jesus after he resurrected that's kind of like the whole reason why we're here because he resurrected so how about how about that how about we land on that they use common sense not only that but they they did what Jesus did they constantly found themselves in prayer they were together they were united what was Jesus always doing he was he was he was saying scriptures he was praying he was bringing people together and so we don't see in the old testament Jesus cast or in the in the gospel stories we don't see Jesus cast lots but they prayed before and we're like man we don't know how maybe this is the way and because of that the disciples did what they could to rely on God they did all these things before they ever made a decision and so for us today what kind of decisions would we make if this was the process we went through to make choices okay before I ever do this before I ever jump to a conclusion about X Y Z am I being obedient to the Lord am I seeking his face have I have I asked those who are around me who know me have I asked those in my church hey I've got this big decision coming up like I need some help with this can you can you help speak into that can we be united and in fellowship with one another they prayed together what are you praying about big decisions are you praying about any decision are you in the scriptures and not only that but are you praying may your kingdom come may your will be done not may my kingdom come may my will be done sometimes in decisions we just need to use some common sense and when all else fails WWJD what would Jesus do but most importantly are we doing what we can to rely on God the disciples did all that in like 15 verses would you pray with me God we thank you for the wisdom and guidance that we find in your word help us to make godly decisions that honor you and bring about your kingdom not our own that bring about your will and not our own father may we be people who pray stir something within us that allows us to pray to be people who pray because that's what you modeled to us Jesus and that's what your disciples did help us to pray not just individually but with our spouses with our families with the people in our lives we thank you Lord that you are with us help us to not forget your word help us to be obedient to it in Jesus name everyone said amen amen
