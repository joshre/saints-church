## Transcription

Amen.

All right, this morning we will spend our time in Galatians chapter 4, verses 12 through 20.

But before we get there, why doesn't somebody read...

Let's just read all of chapter 4 and then we'll camp out for the remainder of our morning.

Galatians 4.

I will read the NIV.

What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.

The heir is subject to the guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.

So also when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces of the world.

But when the set time had fully come, God sent his son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law that we might receive adoption to sonship.

Because you are his sons, God sent the spirit of his son into our hearts, the spirit who calls out Abba, father.

So you are no longer a slave but God's child.

And since you are his child, God has made you also an heir.

Formally, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who, by nature, are not gods.

But now that you know God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces?

Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?

You are observing special days and months and seasons and years.

I fear for you that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.

I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you.

You did me no wrong.

As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you.

And even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn.

Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.

Where then is your blessing of me now?

I can testify that if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.

Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?

These people, those people, are zealous to win you over but for no good.

What they want is to alienate you from us so that you may have zeal for them.

It is fine to be zealous provided the purpose is good and to be so always and to be so always not just with them.

I am with you, my dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone because I am perplexed by you.

Tell me you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says?

For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.

His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise.

These things are being taken figuratively.

The women represent two covenants.

One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves.

This is Hagar.

Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem because she is in slavery with her children but the Jerusalem that is above is free and she is our mother.

For it is written, be glad barren woman you who never bore a child, shout for joy and cry aloud you who were never in labor because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.

Now you brothers and sisters like Isaac are children of promise.

At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the spirit.

It is the same now but what does the scripture say?

Get rid of the slave woman and her son for the slave woman's son will never share the inheritance with the free woman's son.

Therefore brothers and sisters we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman.

There we go.

All right so we'll spend our time in verses 12 through 20 and as we've all seen sort of walking through all of Galatians we have seen Paul really connect old covenants right mainly the covenant with Abraham and then the covenant with Moses and now he's connected those to the new covenant in Christ and Paul takes a turn from theology and goes to his personal testimony and we get a peek into his time with the Galatians but also how Paul has pastored these people and he starts verse 12.

Brothers I entreat you become as I am for I also have become as you are you did me no wrong.

So Paul says become as I am.

Paul is not telling them to look like Paul in personality or in dress or in appearance he's saying become as I am in relationship to the law become free in Christ Jesus.

To you Gentiles I ate with you which of course to the Jews would have been completely offensive but he became like the Gentiles to reach the Gentiles so by his actions he was showing the Galatian church both Jew and Gentile what it looked like to be free in Christ and I think in our context passages like this get misunderstood all the time and misused all the time because people argue well Jesus hung out with prostitutes and here Paul is becoming like the world around him and first we must recognize we are not Jesus and so just because Jesus was hanging with people like that doesn't mean we have to I'm not saying we shouldn't evangelize or we shouldn't put ourselves around people who are whether it be non-believers or people who aren't saved or engage with people or engage with hurting and broken people but we also must use common sense and if you're married and I would probably argue if you're single you probably shouldn't be hanging out with a prostitute.

Jesus did not sin and we do so this isn't exactly a copy and paste situation.

Paul is hanging out with Gentiles and there was such a drastic way of life then for Jew and Gentile that it would have been obvious to see the difference it would have been obvious to know okay this person is a Jew this person is a Gentile and in our culture there is a divide between believer and non-believer but especially in the south that could be a little harder to recognize and so then how do we as believers today make our faith obvious and of course following the words of Jesus love the Lord your God with our hearts whole mind strength love your neighbor as yourself so the way we live and the way we treat others but I think a little more specifically and two areas I'm working on this is first in my humility and specifically through apologizing it seems like in our culture we don't hear or see people apologize too often and I believe a way we can show the forgiveness of Jesus is by asking people for forgiveness and it's not just like an I'm sorry but like really spell it out really owning it and asking for a genuine apology and asking for forgiveness and in that way we show humility and we also show the forgiveness of God by asking for the forgiveness of others and just not something we see too often these days another thing is balancing both grace and truth there's a tension with grace and truth and in our culture I have at times become afraid of telling the truth because I'm worried of how that might make other people feel or truthfully I'm worried that they might reject me right or dismiss me and yes we should to some extent be thinking about how others will receive the message we're sending or receive the message they're hearing but we also should be able to manage the tension of difficult conversations and also not canceling people out of our lives because we disagree with them and that has been something that's very easy to do in our culture is just okay they disagree with me unfriend them unfollow them I'll just I'll change churches I'll change the grocery store I go to so I don't have to see these people anymore and that's a cowardice we do not see in Jesus and that we as believers cannot live in now we have to be able to balance both grace and truth and tactfully disagree with people and I would say if you can't tact it tactfully disagree with people then you probably should shut your mouth that's not exactly what Paul was dealing with but as I was going through this I was just some life application for you so take it or leave it that's what I'm working on verse 13 you know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preach the gospel to you at first and we don't know exactly the bodily ailment that Paul was dealing with some have referred theologians have referred to it some have referred theologians have referred to it sometimes as the thorn in his side we don't in Acts we don't get the exact context of like what Paul was going throughout that time we could assume that it had to do that there was some eye issue since just later on in the passage he mentions you would have gouged your eyes out and so maybe that's what Paul is referring to maybe not we have no idea so there's no clear evidence to what Paul is referring to but we do know he ended up in Galatia on accident I believe it's Acts 17 16 17 18 somewhere in there on accident but they received not only just received Paul but they received the gospel and then Paul continues in verse 14 and though my condition was a trial to you so they bared on Paul you did not scorn or despise me but receive me as an angel of God as Christ Jesus what then has become of your blessedness that's verse 15 for I testify to you that if possible you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me so they treated Paul with such great hospitality and they received him like they received Jesus himself which is the cultural context it would have been an anomaly that they received Paul like this it it only had to be by the spirit because like physical infirmity and illness were regarded by both Jew and Gentile as simple of divine displeasure as it was written in one of the commentaries I read or punishment so there was something wrong with Paul and the gods or Yahweh for the Jews point he would have been deemed as unclean or he would have been deemed as like stay away from this guy he is a poison to our society and there would have been a natural temptation for the Galatians to despise Paul and reject his message but they received him like it was Christ himself which is just I mean it it had to be the Holy Spirit and so these people received the gospel with such power and with such enthusiasm that they would have gouged their eyes out and so Paul reminds the church how because remember he's written this whole letter and you know it wasn't chapter and verse and so Paul just lays out this whole theology of of the new covenant and kind of lays into him and then goes remember how you received me like you didn't receive me like I was just some schmuck you didn't receive me like I was some fool you received me like you received Christ in and of myself and so verse 16 have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth he's going like remember the whole thing like remember what we used to have remember me remember this whole encounter that we had you would have gouged your eyes out for me and so have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth this whole message that I laid out for you of what our faith is it has what what Jesus means to each and every one of us and how I became like you and how you have just how you received me and received the gospel message that I brought and so don't be surprised that I'm bringing you the truth yet again so the Galatians should not read the first half of this letter and be offended or be apprehensive about Paul by just simply telling them the truth and Paul reminds them of the great love and honor the Galatians had shown towards Paul and the great blessing they received from God when they so when they showed such kindness to Paul the Galatians should not think that Paul has now become their enemy when he confronted them with the truth verse 17 they make they make much of you but for no good purpose they want to shut you out that you may make much of them so Paul is calling out the religious zealots and the religious leaders who would have come in to to who desire to bring this legalism and the added yoke of the law to these Galatian believers and they spoke with enthusiastic and convincing ways right like in the niv it said they're they zealously spoke of you spoke to you so they were enthusiastic and it was convincing but for the wrong things and the Galatian church fell for it so Paul is calling them out they want to make much of you but for no good reason they want to shut you out that they may make much of them so the reason they're preaching this is not for you but it's for them to make the the Jewish believers who were teaching that it was the works of Jesus and also following the law they're doing that not for you but for them to make themselves feel better and so that they could lord it over you Paul continues verse 18 it is always good to be made much of for a good purpose and not only when I am present with you so Paul's going it's good to be enthusiastic towards things of good purpose and Paul is hoping it's not just when he's around but that the gospel truth would stick to the believers and that would it would take root in their hearts and minds he says in verse 19 my little children for who I am again in the anguish anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone for I am perplexed about you so as Paul has raised these believers up he's feeling the pains of childbirth because of their turning from the gospel that's really strong language and he addresses that I wish I could tell you this message in person and I could change my tone but he's so lit up about the gospel and the way that they have turned from it that he has the the anguish of childbirth he is like just completely dismayed he is perplexed about how they have received this message and he's just yeah he's just like what happened what's going on and Paul is like I just like come on guys we I thought you I thought you got it was it were you just like pleasing me because I was there and we had this moment and now that I've left your you've turned to foolish ways do you not see these people they they're doing this not for you but for themselves and look at how you receive me I I was hurting you you helped me I was you would have gouged your eyes out for me like you you had no reason to accept me and to accept the message that I had given you and then you turn around and do this was it for no good reason Paul is saying and as I was reading studying and looking at the passage there are some principles that the few different commentaries that I look at they they all they both pointed at this thing and I didn't want to share it because it it just it kind of feels weird but I my job is to stay true to the text so it would be foolish of me if I'm looking at different commentaries and they all say the same thing it would be foolish of me not to mention this at this part I'd be doing you a disservice it's not about me so but something that the commentators point out and this kind of turns turns what we're talking about a little bit but in this passage in this chunk of scripture we see the relationship that the Galatians had with Paul right and then the relationship that Paul had with the Galatians and what the commentaries we're getting at is the principles for the attitude for people in the church toward their pastor and also the principles for the attitude for the pastor towards the people in his church and so I'm going to read this from one of the commentaries that I frequently turn to and we'll start with the principles so we'll go over the two different kinds of principles the principles for the attitude for the people in the church toward their pastor and then the principle for the attitude for the pastor towards people in his church then we're going to reread the passage so we can feel it see it and then we'll carry on my wayward son let's start with the principles for the attitude for people in the church toward their pastor principles for the attitude for the people in the church toward their pastor their attitude must not be determined by his personal appearance or personality their attitude must not be determined by their own theological whims their attitude should not be or sorry their attitude should be determined by his loyalty to the apostolic message in the bible principles for the attitude for the people in the church toward their pastor i'll read those again the attitude must not be must not be determined by his personal appearance or personality their attitude must not be determined by their own theological whims their attitude should be determined by his loyalty to the apostolic message in the bible the principles for the attitude for the pastor towards the people in his church he must be willing to serve and sacrifice for his people he must tell the truth he must love his people deeply never for a selfish motive he must desire to see more than mere excitement but zeal for good things he must desire to form jesus in them not himself in them let's read this passage one more time with kind of that perspective of these two attitudes and principles and just so we can see it you might have already kind of seen it while we were reading through the passage maybe just breezed over it and as we were walking through it you might not have seen it or caught it but let's focus in and i'll read it to us and see if you can see those principles in the relationship from the pastor the church the church pastor brothers i entreat you become as i am for i also have become as you are you did me no wrong you know it was because of a bodily ailment that i preached the gospel to you at first and though my condition was a trial to you you did not scorn or despise me but receive me as an angel of god as christ jesus what then has become of your blessedness for i testified to you that if possible you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me have i then become your enemy by telling you the truth they make much of you but for no good purpose they want to shut you out that they may make much of them it is always good to be made much of for a good purpose but not only when i am present with you my little children for whom i am again in the anguish of childbirth until christ is formed in you i wish i could be present with you now and change my tone for i am perplexed about you
