## Transcription

All right Acts chapter 5 this morning and yeah typically we read we do verse by verse teaching and preaching and we still are except instead of verse by verse we're doing chapter by chapter so this week we are in Acts chapter 5 and this morning I really want to focus in on like one part of Acts chapter 5 and then really zoom out and see this chapter at least as as I see it and really as I see it it's kind of painting a picture for us for Jesus and his church and so let me pray for us then I will read the chapter and then we are off to the races Lord Jesus we thank you for your word Would you speak to us this morning may we see you for who you are for what you have done what you are continuing to do We love you Lord and we thank you for this time this morning and it's in Jesus name everyone said Amen Okay, let me read Acts chapter 5 for us But a man named Ananias with his wife Sapphira sold a piece of property And with his wife's knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds And brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles feet But Peter said Ananias Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?

While it remained unsold did it not remain your own and after it was sold was it not at your disposal?

Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart?

You have not lied to man, but to God When Ananias heard these words he fell down and breathed his last And great fear came upon all who heard of it The young men rose and wrapped him up And carried him out and buried him After an interval of about three hours his wife came in Not knowing what had happened And Peter said to her Tell me whether you sold the land for so much And she said yes for so much But Peter said to her How is it that you have agreed together to test the spirit of the Lord?

Behold the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door And they will carry you out Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last When the young men came in they found her dead And they carried her out and buried her beside her husband And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things Now many signs and wonders were regularly done among the people By the hands of the apostles And they were all together in Solomon's portico None of them dared join them But the people held them in high esteem And more than ever Believers were added to the Lord Multitudes of both men and women So that they even carried out the sick into the streets And laid them on cots and mats That as Peter came by At least his shadow might fall on some of them The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem Bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits And they were all healed But the high priest rose up And all who were with him That is the party of the Sadducees And filled with jealousy They arrested the apostles And put them in public prison During the night an angel of the Lord Opened the prison doors And brought them out and said Go and stand in the temple And speak to the people all the words of this life And when they heard this They entered the temple at daybreak And began to teach Now when the high priest came up And those who were with him They called together the council All the senate of all the people of Israel And sent to the prison to have them brought When the officers came They did not find them in prison So they returned and reported We found the prison securely locked And the guards standing at the doors But when we opened them We found no one inside Now when the captain of the temple And the chief priests heard these words They were greatly perplexed about them Wondering what this would come to And someone came and told them Look, the men whom you put in prison Are standing in the temple And teaching the people Then the captain with the officers Went and brought them But not by force For they were afraid of being stoned By the people And when they had brought them They set them before the council And the high priest questioned them Saying, we strictly charge you Not to teach in his name Yet here you have filled Jerusalem With your teaching And you intend to bring This man's blood upon us But Peter and the apostles answered We must obey God Rather than man The God of our fathers Raised Jesus Whom you killed By hanging him on a tree God exalted him At his right hand As leader and savior To give repentance to Israel And forgiveness of sins And we are witnesses to these things So is the Holy Spirit Whom God has given to those Who obey him When they heard this They were enraged And wanted to kill them But a Pharisee in the council Named Gamaliel A teacher of the law Held in honor By all the people Stood up and gave orders To put the men outside For a little while And when he said to them Men of Israel Take care of what you are about To do with these men For before these days Thedas rose up Claiming to be somebody And a number of men About four hundred Joined him Was killed And all who followed him Were dispersed And came to nothing After him Judas the Galilean Rose up in the days Of the census And drew away Some of the people After him He too perished And all who followed him Were scattered So in this present case I tell you Keep away from these men And let them alone For if this plan Or this undertaking Is of man It will fail But if it is of God You will not be able To overthrow them You might even Be found opposing God So they took his advice And when they And when they had called In the apostles They beat them And charged them Not to speak in the name of Jesus And let them go Then they let the presence of the Then they left the presence Of the council Rejoicing That they were counted Worthy to suffer Dishonor for the name And every day In the temple And from house to house They did not cease Teaching and preaching That the Christ Is Jesus A lot A lot A lot to cover In 30 minutes But we're gonna do it Okay so as chapter 5 starts As we turn back to 5 verse 1 We have to remember That chapters and verses Were added later on So Luke The writer of Acts Gives us another summary Of the early church And when we read The last summary With the first story In chapter 5 We get a clearer picture So if you still Are in your Bibles Let me read for us Acts 4 Starting in verse 36 I actually have this one On the screen It says So this is the end Of chapter 4 And the beginning of verse 5 Put together And we get this Much clearer picture Of what Luke Is trying to do here Thus Joseph Who was also called Also called by the apostles Barnabas Which means son of encouragement A Levite A native of Cyprus Sold the field That belonged to him And brought the money And laid it at the apostles' feet But a man named Ananias With his wife Sapphira Sold a piece of property And with his wife's knowledge He kept back for himself Some of the proceeds And brought only a part of it And laid it at the apostles' feet So you see here If we just stop thinking About chapters and verses We see it's like Two of the same stories Just two very different outcomes We see Barnabas Who sold a property And laid it at the apostles' feet And then we see Ananias and Sapphira Also sold a property And laid it at the apostles' feet Just held back for themselves Some of it So we can see there's How intentionally Luke put these Two stories next to each other And there's like So many ways We could break this down But first What I want us to notice From Ananias and Sapphira Is that their actions Actions were premeditated It tells us in verse 2 With his wife's knowledge So Ananias told her Hey, I'm gonna say We sold our land And give it to the church But we'll see We'll keep some of this back For ourselves Or maybe his wife Had the great idea first Like hey, what if we Like just say We keep it And we You know We say we sold it And you know Then we just like Keep just a little bit Just you know Just so we can go on that trip To Bali It'd be awesome Obviously they didn't go to Bali But Just a joke The text does not Clearly give us their motives But we can tell From their actions That they desired The look Of selling Their possessions To give to the church They desired that look They desired What Barnabas did They really They wanted to do that But And maybe they Wanted some More notoriety In the church Maybe they wanted The clout Or the popularity That came with bringing I sold my property And here it is And laying it at the apostles feet We don't get All those details But we can Clearly see That That's not what God desires For his church Then Nor what he desires For his church Now Let's continue With verse 3 But Peter said Ananias Why has Satan Filled your heart To lie to the Holy Spirit And to keep back For yourself Part of the proceeds Of the land So clearly We see the Spirit Was speaking Through Peter And so Peter speaks up And confronts Ananias And notice here How Peter says He lied to the Holy Spirit He did not say That he lied to the apostles Or he lied to everyone else In the church He said You lied to the Holy Spirit And Just doctrinally We believe Like Peter believed That the Holy Spirit Was a person Because You can only lie To another person To another person But he also believed That the Holy Spirit Is God Because Peter later Will say In verse 4 That he lied To God Let's continue to read Verse 3 through verse 11 But Peter said Ananias Why has Satan Filled your heart To lie to the Holy Spirit And to keep back For yourself Part of the proceeds Of the land While it remained unsold Did it not remain your own?

And after it was sold Was it not at your disposal?

Why is it that you have Contrived this deed In your heart?

You have not lied To man But to God When Ananias Heard these words He fell down And breathed his last And great fear Came upon all Who heard of it After an interval Of about three hours His wife came in Not knowing what had Happened And Peter said to her Tell me whether You sold the land For so much And she said Yes, for so much But Peter said to her How is it that you Have agreed together To test the Spirit Of the Lord?

The feet of those Who have buried your husband Are at the door And they will carry you out Immediately She fell down At his feet And breathed her last When the young men came in They found her dead And they carried her out And buried her Beside her husband And great fear Came upon The whole church And upon all Who heard of these things The issue That I see here With their actions It has nothing to do With money Like no one told them They had to give up All of their money And that's what Peter said Like hey Like no one Like you You kind of came up With this on your own Like once you sold it It was your money You didn't have to lie to us You didn't have to Like tell us Or like No one told them They had to give up All the money Or even sell their property But they desired To be of that status This story is often Compared to the story Of Achan In the book of Joshua This is Joshua About chapter 6 7 So the Israelites They just march around Jericho We all know that story From growing up If not The Israelites They're supposed to have This land They're supposed to have This property And God tells Tells Joshua To tell the people Hey march around the city For seven days Once You know You march around the city One time each day Then on the seventh day You're gonna march around Seven times You're gonna blow your trumpets And then the walls Are gonna fall down That's That's what we see In the book of Joshua About chapter 6 And But God also tells The Israelites Hey don't take any Of their possessions Don't take any silver Don't take any gold Don't take anything Well They all do a good job Of this Except for this guy Achan And Achan He takes Some silver He takes some gold And it tells us In Joshua 7 That the silver and gold That he saw the silver and gold And he coveted it He desired it He desired the things Of this world More than the commands Of God Let me say that again Achan desired the things Of this world More than the commands Of God And that is you and me Constantly The story of Achan Ends with His confession of sin He's brought before Joshua And he says Hey I did this The silver and gold They're in my tent They go get the silver and gold From his tent And Achan His whole family All of his All of his belongings And including Even his livestock They're stoned And killed It's no wonder Then in Acts 5 Verse 5 And also later In verse 11 We see it two times That great fear Came upon all who heard it When this story happened With Ananias and Sapphira When they both died Great fear Came upon it In fact in verse 11 It says great fear Came upon the whole church And upon all who heard These things And this story It should drive fear Into you and me My brothers and sisters Let me tell you that we Have a sin problem And we do not fully understand Our sin problem We are so comfortable With our sin We are so comfortable In our sin nature The results Of Ananias and Sapphira Should bring fear Not because They dropped dead But because they lied And that's why They dropped dead They held back Some of the money For themselves And it led To death That is sin The wages of sin Is death This week I was talking with Some of the guys Here in our church And this John Owen quote Came up And John Owen He's smart Old dead guy He lived in the 1600s Just an incredible man of faith And let me read This quote For us And it will also be on the screen It says Sin aims always At the utmost Every time It rises up To tempt Or entice Might it have its own course It would go out To the utmost sin In that kind Every unclean thought Or glance Would be adultery If it could Every covetous desire Would be oppression Every thought of unbelief Would be atheism Might it grow to its head This is exactly What Jesus is saying On the Sermon on the Mount Matthew 5 21 You shall not murder And whoever murders You will be liable To judgment But I say Jesus says That everyone Who is angry With his brother Will be liable To judgment If you are simply Angry with your brother You are liable To be a murderer Verse 27 Verse 27 You have heard it said You shall not commit adultery But I say to you That everyone Who looks at a woman With lustful intent Has already committed adultery With her in his heart Our sin Whatever sin Whatever sin you have If it could have its way with you It would destroy you It would destroy your life And that should scare you It scares me It scares me Your anger Your lust Your desire Your desire to be liked To be preferred Your desire to have certain things Or to be of a certain status Or to want this sort of notoriety Whatever Your desire even to be right If it could have its way with you It would destroy you And so what do we do with it?

What do we do with that?

Do we just sit?

And let our sin cripple us?

Do we let the reality of sin Even at the smallest Destroy us?

Or in the midst Of seeing how sinful you are We look To Jesus Christ Of Nazareth We look at him His life And his work On the cross The man who knew no sin And yet he became sin for us The God-man who took on flesh And bones And lived a perfect life So that you and I Don't have to Do we sit?

And wallow in our sin?

Or do we look?

At our Savior At our Savior I'm reminded of these words of Paul In Ephesians chapter 2 For by grace You have been saved through faith And this is not your own doing It is the gift of God Not a result of works So that no one may boast So that no one may boast It is by the grace of God That we have been saved Not through our own doing Not through what I've done Because what I have done Is like filthy rags Compared to what Christ has done for me It is a gift of God It is a gift of God Not a result of works So that no one may boast I've got some more to preach But I just want to take a moment right now and pray Loving, gracious and merciful Father We thank you for your son We thank you for the reminder of the cross Where our sin was laid upon him And he became the punishment for our sin And we also remember That on the third day he rose from the grave Defeating hell, death, sin and the grave And it is through his works that we are saved None of our own Would you reveal the sin in us?

And may we not just feel sick about our sin And sick about how broken we are May we throw our sin upon you Because you've already paid for it And may we be reminded that As far as the east is from the west Is how far our sin is from us Because of you, Jesus Christ We love you And it's in Jesus name Amen Let's turn to verse 12 through 21 here Where it says Now many signs and wonders Were regularly done among the people By the hands of the apostles They were all together in Solomon's portico None of the rest dared join them But the people held them in high esteem And more than ever The believers were added to the Lord Multitudes of both men and women So that they even carried out the sick into the streets And laid them on cots and mats That as Peter came by At least his shadow might fall on some of them The people also gathered around From the towns around Jerusalem Bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits And they were all healed But the high priest rose up And all who were with him That is the party of the Sadducees And filled with jealousy They arrested the apostles And put them in public prison But during the night An angel of the Lord opened the prison doors And brought them out And said go And stand in the temple And go speak to the people All the words of this life And when they heard this They entered the temple And began And at daybreak Began to teach So what do we see here?

More signs Right?

More signs More healings More things of that nature It's beautiful And it's so easy for us To get caught up in the signs But again Signs are never the point Jesus Jesus' signs Brought about legitimacy To his message And to his power and authority And the same goes here With the apostles And it's no wonder That people are lining up To be healed The same thing happened with Jesus But just as Jesus did not Stay around for the healing lines The apostles did not either They stayed on mission as well And in fact What does the angel of the Lord Tell the apostles to go and do?

It says in verse 20 To speak life Speak to the people The words of this life Speak to them And preach to them About Jesus Faith comes by hearing Not healing Hello Acts 5, 21-26 continues Actually we're going to read Yeah, through 26 And now when the high priest came Those who were with him They called together the council All the senate of the people of Israel And sent to the prison To have them brought But when the officers came They did not find them in prison So they returned And reported We found the prison securely locked And the guards standing at the doors But when we opened them We found no one inside What happened?

Now when the captain of the temple And the chief priests Heard these words They were greatly perplexed About them Wondering What this would come to And someone Came and told them Look!

The men whom you have put in prison Are standing in the temple And teaching the people Then the captain with the officers Went and brought them But not by force For they were afraid Of being stoned by the people So while the officers Are on their manhunt The apostles were doing What the angel of the Lord What Jesus himself Had told them to do Go and teach Go and proclaim the gospel And when they finally Find them in the temple Preaching and proclaiming The gospel They went and got them But not by force Because they did not Want to cause a scene Excuse me sir I hear you are preaching Can you please come with me?

Verse 27 continues And when they had brought them They set them Before the council And the high priest Questioned them Saying We strictly charge you Not to teach in this name Yet you are here And have filled Jerusalem With your teaching And you attend To bring this man's blood Upon us But Peter and the apostles Answered We must obey God Rather than men The God of our fathers Raised Jesus Whom you killed By hanging him On a tree And God exalted him At the right hand As leader and savior To give repentance To Israel And forgiveness of sins And we are witnesses To these things So it is the Holy Spirit Whom God has given To those who obey him The council is like Hey We told you not to teach here We told you not to do this Do you remember?

We had this little Artication just a few days ago Maybe a week ago You remember that?

And then I am reminded Of the theme song From the show Malcolm in the Middle You are not the boss of me now You are not the boss of me now And you are not so big Sorry Just reliving my childhood That is what the apostle said to him In my paraphrase Acts 5 33-39 says When they heard this They were enraged And wanted to kill them I could see why But a Pharisee In the council Named Gamaliel A teacher of the law Held in honor By all the people Stood up and gave orders To put the men outside For a little while And he said to them Men of Israel Take care of what You are about to do With these men For before these days Thedas rose up Claiming to be somebody And a number of men About 400 joined him He was killed And all who followed him Were dispersed And came to nothing After him Judas The Galilean Rose up In the days of the census And drew away Some of the people After him He too perished And all who followed him Were scattered So in the present case I tell you Keep away from these men And let them alone For if this plan Or this undertaking Is of man It will not fail But if it is of God You will not be able To overthrow them You might even be found Opposing God So this guy Gamaliel He wisely Says hey Look at these other movements Look at these other people And things That were happening In our times And in our days And who rose up And they started this Commotion among us And if these guys In front of us here If these apostles If these apostles If this Peter If this Just common Ordinary man If he Is like them Then we will be Kicking ourselves For spending so much time Trying to fight against them Or They could be from God And we will not be able To overthrow them And in fact We might even be found Opposing God If you ask me This guy kind of seems like An inside plant Like he's for sure Like he's working Behind enemy lines He's not He's not to be trusted But it tells us Right before verse 40 They took it as advice And when they had called The apostles in They beat them And charged them Not to speak In the name of Jesus And let them go They left the council They left the presence Of the council Rejoicing that they were Counted worthy To suffer For the name And every day In the temple And from house to house They did not cease Teaching and preaching That the Christ Is Jesus When I look at this chapter If I were to give it A phrase If somebody were to Come up to me On the street And say like How would you sum up Acts chapter 5 Like in one sentence I would say This is Christ Protecting his church This is Jesus Protecting his church We can see how quickly Humans wanted to Corrupt the church From the inside With the story of Ananias and Sapphira And then we can see Some external opposition From the Jewish leaders Coming against the Early believers And what is God doing In the midst of all that?

He's protecting them Jesus' words remain true I will build my church And the gates of hell Shall not prevail Against it Then and now We will see corrupt people In the church We will see enemies Outside of the church Opposing the church But Jesus is building His church And we can trust That his words Are true We see Gamaliel Even just say At the very end Of this chapter Hey there was these Different people And Thedas And Judas The Galilean And they They created And caused this Commotion And this chaos But eventually Their ways Passed And here we are Two thousand plus Years later Still talking Still reading Still reminding Ourselves Still believing That this Is the Truth Christ Protects his church It seems like The more that we see AI Take shape And the more People are like The end is coming The world is coming To an end It's like your favorite Sci-fi movie Is about to come to life And nobody really wants that It's very easy To get all doom And gloom And just like I'm just gonna Become a hermit I'm gonna go in my shell And just like Wait it out But as a person Of faith As a Jesus follower We always have to go Yeah but The gospel Yeah but Jesus Yeah He told us How the story Is going to end And whether I meet Jesus at the gates Or he comes down From heaven first I know how the story ends And so that should Completely change Our outlook on life Awesome!

The end is coming That's great!

That's incredible!

I need to be filled With the Spirit And proclaim His gospel Proclaim His message The fact that More people are Worried that the end Of the world Is coming Should in fact Be fuel to the fire For us To be people who Preach And teach And as we see In the end of Acts Chapter 5 In the temples And from house To house What messages Are being taught In your house?

What words Are being spoken In your house?

What are the things That are being Caught And taught In your house?

As Christians We have the hope Of the world In Jesus Christ And we can look At hard times We can look at A rough economy We can look at Weird situations With a glass half full Because we know How the story ends So do not lose hope So do not lose hope I also want us to notice What happened To the apostles As they were leaving The Sadducees And the high priests They were beaten They were beaten The Christian life Is not a scar free life We know that from his And we know that from ours But yet again We can hold on To the words Of Jesus Christ John Chapter 16 Jesus says In this world You will have troubles But take heart Take courage For I have overcome The world The world What's our job What's our responsibility In this crazy world And in this crazy picture That we see in Acts Chapter 5 Preach And proclaim The Gospel As we gather here at church From that church And from house to house Why can we do that?

Because Christ is protecting His church If you are a Christian You are part of his church You are part of his bride You are protected Would you pray with me?

Father we know We have sinned against you We know how corrupt Our hearts are Would you help us To repent of our sin And turn back to you?

Father would you conform Our hearts and minds In the image of your son Jesus Christ We thank you that you are in control And that our hope is secure The cure in you Because you are the alpha And the omega The beginning And the end The first And the last We thank you that we can trust you fully Help us to do that In Jesus name Everyone said Amen And amen Thank you for being here this morning We will see you next weekend Have a great Thanksgiving Have a great Thanksgiving And have a great week Have a great week
