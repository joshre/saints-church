## Transcription

All right, good morning.

Good morning.

Good morning.

We will be in John chapter 15 this morning.

And before we jump right into the text and read that through, just wanted to remind you and re-invite you to our family dinner party that's coming up this Friday at Stephen Janet's house.

We're all familiar with dinner parties.

This time we're just including the kiddos.

And so come on out.

I think there's going to be stuff set up for them and different games or activities or bounce houses or water slides or who knows.

Right.

Could be both.

Both.

Both.

And it'll also feature a cow.

So that'll be cool.

And a live one.

And a live one.

That's another story for another time.

But and then so so sorry a calf.

Calf.

It's a baby cow.

Anyways, so that's Friday.

And then the following Wednesday, I believe it's June the 18th, we have our serve night.

We'll be going downtown and serving the homeless.

There's a ministry there.

The name is Left Me.

And anyways, they have a whole thing and a whole set up and we'll get you all the details and waivers and things that you need to sign and whatnot.

And then if you again, we'll just confirm with me that you're coming.

We have a certain amount of spots that we have available.

And so if we don't have those filled up, then I'll let them know so that we can get those filled.

But yeah, that'll be June the 18th.

That is Wednesday.

And so we'll be sending all the details for that.

But yeah, so Friday.

It's our family dinner party.

Bring the kids if you want to.

Now you should bring them.

Then the following Wednesday, we have our serve opportunity.

Please do not miss that.

So, John, chapter 15, we can read verses nine through the end of the chapter.

John 15, starting at verse nine through the end of a spilled coffee.

Just kidding.

Nine through 27.

That's the end of the chapter.

John 15, nine through the end of the chapter.

Can I read it?

Please.

No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing, but I have called you friends.

For all that I have heard from my father, I have made known to you.

You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should evolve, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.

These things I command you, so that you will love one another.

If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.

If you were of the world, the world would love you as it did them.

But because you were not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.

Remember the word that I said to you.

The servant is not greater than his master.

If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you.

If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.

For all these things they would do to you on account of my name, because they do not know when you said them.

If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin.

But now they have no excuse for their sins.

Whoever hates me hates my father also.

If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin.

But now they have seen and hated both me and my father.

But the word that is written in their law must be fulfilled.

They hated me without a cause.

But when the helper comes to you, I will send to you from the Father the Spirit of Truth who proceeds from the Father.

You will bear witness about me.

And you will also bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.

Awesome.

Thank you.

So last week we touched a bit on the abiding in Jesus' love.

We read that verse 9 and 10 there as we start.

As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you, abide in my love.

If you keep my commands, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commands and abide in his love.

And as I was doing my study this week, I fell upon this quote that I thought was worthy of sharing with you this morning.

And so it goes like this.

The essence of Christian theology is grace.

And the essence of Christian ethics is gratitude.

The essence of Christian theology is grace.

And the essence of Christian ethics is gratitude.

So we are not driven to obey Christ in order to get in good with God.

We are driven to obey Christ by a heart that is filled with gratitude for the way he has plucked us out of this world and poured his love out on us.

The essence of Christian theology is grace.

It is by grace you have been saved through faith.

That's great.

And the essence of Christian ethics, the way we live, starts with gratitude.

And again, as we read these words, we've got to remember the context.

These are sort of the famous last words of Jesus that he will speak to his disciples.

His magnum obis, if you will, before the cross.

Of course, after the cross we get the Great Commission and all those good things, all those goodies.

But we actually see some of those things that he says in the Great Commission here now.

So he's just kind of repeating himself.

We'll get to that here momentarily.

And Jesus is here in this room and he is pouring out his heart to his disciples.

Why?

Why is he doing that?

Why is Jesus sharing all of these words?

Is he laying out the blueprint?

Is he giving the framework for how to have a blessed life?

Is that the purpose?

He's giving his disciples the framework for how to have a purpose-driven life.

Is that what Jesus is doing?

Sure, there's some of that in there.

But if that's all that we get from the passage, then we're really sort of...

Then first, I wasted all of last week teaching about how much Jesus loves us, how much he cares for us.

And Jesus is not simply just giving his disciples some points, although we will see those points.

But Jesus is sharing with his friends.

He is sharing with his friends.

Verse 12.

Greater love is knowing this, that someone laid down his life for his friends.

Jesus is saying, you are my friends.

I'm about to take up the cross, not merely because that is my purpose, not merely because that is what I came to this earth to do.

But I love you and I care about you and you are my friends.

And here we get to read this conversation almost as like two flies on the wall, seeing what Jesus is telling and sharing with his friends.

You are my friends, verse 14, if you do what I command you.

The way this reads in English, it makes it seem like there's a condition.

It's a conditional statement.

Like it since you are my friends, you will do what I command.

And if you don't do what I command, then you are not my friends.

That's how it reads.

Right.

You are my friends if you see there's that condition.

If you do what I command you.

However, this verse is probably better read.

You are my friends and you will do what I command.

He's saying you, you followed me for three years.

You've been with me for these three years and not you're going to do what I've told you to do.

Verse 15, no longer do I call you servants for the servant does not know what his master is doing, but I've called you friends for all that I have heard from my father.

I have made known to you.

Jesus isn't saying when he says no longer do I call you servants.

Jesus is not saying I am no longer your master or I'm no longer your lord.

He is he is saying I was your master.

I was your rabbi, your professor.

But congratulations.

Flip your tassels.

It's graduation day.

You are no longer.

I am no longer just your professor.

You are no longer just my student.

You are my friend.

You are my friend.

I remember I went to a small private university in Northern California and usually at the start of class because, you know, it's a Christian university.

And it's all about relationship and the and the professors were super relational.

And the first thing that they would say in classes, you don't have to call me professor.

You can call me friend.

You can call me friend.

You can you can call me.

You can just call me by my first name.

You can call me Les.

You can call me Dennis.

You can call me Fritz.

Yes, those are all three names of professors that I had.

But you are my friends.

And Jesus is sharing these things with his friends.

It's almost like he's talking shop.

I was on staff at a church and two times a month we would all the student pastors would meet with the senior pastor.

And in my first meeting, they all said like, this is like the den of thieves.

Like we share like best practices.

We share like what's working.

Let's not work in a ministry.

We share.

We it's it's our time as peers, as friends.

And we come together and we just sort of talk.

We talk shop.

We talk about church.

We talk about ministry.

And this is what Jesus is doing with his disciples.

He's going like you aren't just taking orders anymore.

You get to know my you get to know my heart.

Right.

Like he says, I have called you friends for all that I have heard from my father.

I have made known to you everything that I everything that the father has told me.

I'm telling you, you get the insider track.

You get you you get to know what is happening.

You see, a servant takes orders.

Right.

Go do this.

Go do that.

But a friend knows motives.

He's sharing with his with his friends everything that the father has told him.

A friend knows the motives.

And Jesus says to his disciples, verse 16, you did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you were my friend.

I appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide so that whatever you ask the father in my name, he may give it to you.

These things I command you so that you will love one another.

Jesus chose his disciples.

They were not just there on accident.

Jesus appointed them, he said.

Jesus chose them on purpose.

Jesus chose them for what?

That they would go and bear fruit.

Right.

That's what it says in the text that they would go and bear fruit.

So, again, we like I just mentioned a little bit ago, we he didn't just command them to go and make disciples in the Great Commission.

This was something he said before he died.

But they would go and bear fruit.

And we know through the Book of Acts that they will struggle to go.

Right.

They they stay in Jerusalem.

Of course, they're waiting for the spirit.

Spirit finally comes.

Acts chapter two.

Right.

And then they stay around there and they have everything in common and all these lovely things that we see at the beginning of Acts.

And they struggle to go.

They struggle to go.

But eventually they're pushed out into Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, into the ends of the earth.

But we know that the disciples did what Jesus commanded that the disciples abound in Jesus.

Why?

Because we're talking about them today.

Here we are.

Two thousand plus years later.

Still talking about, still gathering about the.

Obviously, the work of Jesus.

But also what his disciples and apostles did in and through Jesus.

So they did go and they did bear fruit.

If they did not remain in Jesus, we would not be talking about them right now.

So the question that I want to ask about them then later, we will see how this deals with us.

Because remember, we are looking in on a conversation that Jesus had with his disciples.

So it would be foolish of us to automatically take all these things and apply them to us first.

If we did not look into the text and apply them to how the how it applied exactly to his friends here, the eleven there in that room.

So the question I want to ask is, so how did they bear fruit?

What did they do?

What did the apostles do?

First, verse nine, they abided in his love.

Right.

As the father has loved me, so so have I loved you abide in my love.

They did that.

Verse 10, they kept his commands.

If you keep my commands, you will abide in my love.

Just as I kept my father's commandments and abide in his love.

So they were abounding in Jesus's love.

They kept the commands from Jesus.

And then verse 17.

They would love one another.

These things I command you so that you will love one another.

So the disciples went and bore fruit.

They were not doing it without the love of Jesus.

They were abiding in his love.

Right.

Like we can look to since it's Pentecost, we can look to how the apostles.

They kept gathering.

Right.

If we were to flip a couple of pages to Acts chapter two, we would see how they were gathering.

They were praying.

They were with each other.

They stayed together.

And then the spirit then suddenly.

Right.

That's what it says in Acts chapter two.

Then suddenly the spirit fell and these flaming tongues of fire were above them.

And they started they started sharing the gospel.

So they were not doing it without the love of Jesus and the commands of Jesus.

And they were not doing it alone.

There was a bond, a love for their fellow disciples.

So Jesus expected his disciples to abide in him.

To keep his commands and to love one another.

But Jesus also expected and he told his disciples that there would be joy.

Right.

Verse 11.

These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full.

They would experience the fullness of joy.

And again, we can look ahead in Acts and see.

Oh, let me not get ahead of myself.

They expect can't expect joy.

They can expect hatred.

Verse 18.

If the world hates you know that it hated me before it hated you.

If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own.

But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world.

Therefore, the world hates you.

So Jesus said there should be joy.

Expect hatred.

Then verse 20.

Expect persecution.

Remember the word that I said to you.

A servant is not greater than his master.

If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you.

If you kept my word, they will also keep yours.

So he said my joy is going to be full.

Your joy is going to be full because my joy is going to be full.

Verse 18.

Expect hatred.

They hated me.

They're going to hate you.

Verse 20.

They're about to persecute me.

So they're going to persecute you.

And again, we can look ahead in Acts and see these three things happen with the apostles.

The joy of the indwelling of the spirit and seeing thousands come to faith in Jesus.

Then hatred, right?

They get kicked out of the temple.

What are you doing here?

Get out of here.

Then specifically, we can look to the stoning of Stephen in Acts, Chapter 8, where Stephen is persecuted.

He's killed by the Jews.

So there we go.

Only eight chapters into Acts and everything that Jesus said was going to happen happens.

So like we've said the last couple of weeks, Jesus is preparing his disciples for life after Jesus' ascension.

And so Jesus tells his disciples, yes, there will be joy.

Yes, you will be hated.

Yes, you will be persecuted.

But verse 26.

When the helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will also bear witness about me and you also will bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning.

Jesus is sending a helper and he will help you bear witness about me.

That's what Jesus says.

You're not doing this alone.

I'm not leaving you as orphans, right?

As Jesus said, there is a helper.

Abide, abide, abide, abide, abide, abide, abide, abide, abide, abide, abide, abide, abide.

Abide in my love.

Abide in my commands.

Expect joy.

Expect hatred.

Expect persecution.

But don't forget, I'm sending a helper.

Could you imagine being a fly on the wall in that conversation?

Could you imagine Jesus calling you a friend?

I didn't choose you by accident, he says.

What a charge he gives to his disciples.

And here we are, thousands of years later, reading these words.

And we get to carry on that same mission, that same go and bear fruit.

We get to carry that on through the power of the Spirit.

So what does it mean for us?

First, we must continually remember that Jesus chose you.

Jesus chose you.

He appointed you.

Man, how quickly can I write myself off?

How quickly can you write yourself off?

Jesus chose you.

And I'm sure even me saying those words, you're like, yeah, whatever.

But Jesus chose you and Jesus has appointed you.

Maybe when I'm saying those words and you're thinking about that, maybe you go back to the school play yard and maybe you were the last pick.

Or maybe you think Jesus chose you on accident.

He was going through the list of all the people that he would ever create in the world and he was like, oh, yeah, sure.

Why not?

God does not make mistakes.

You may have been a mistake from your parents.

Hello, me.

But the creator of all things chose you.

And he has appointed you to go and bear fruit.

What does that mean?

Since he chose you, since he appointed you, it means you can do it.

It means you can have the confidence that you can go and do it.

But what are we supposed to do about it?

We must keep in his love.

We must abide in his love.

Apart from me, you can do nothing, Jesus says.

So if you think you're going to live a great Christian life apart from Jesus, boy, are you wrong.

If you think you can go and do it on your own and just willpower your way out of it, boy, are you so far off.

The life of a believer is not about getting all these things right.

The life of a believer is realizing we can't get anything right.

And we must keep in his love.

We must also keep his commands, again, not out of willpower or not out of thinking the love of God is conditional, but out of gratitude.

Man, thank you, God, for giving me your commands so I can know how to live.

I remember Kayla told me when she first came to faith in her 20s.

She was like, I remember I got the Bible and I got all these rules and I was like, this is amazing.

I can know how to live.

God sets us up for success.

And yet how often do and I think this is kind of an earlier struggle than later, but I think we will always struggle with this.

We can see that this the commands of scripture, the commands of God as as restricting rather than protecting.

Thank you, God, for your protection.

Thank you, God, that you only want me to be with one woman.

Thank you.

That's nice.

We must keep his commands, but also we must love one another.

Again, that's verse 17.

These things I command you so that you will love one another.

We must keep in his love.

We must keep his commandments and we must love one another.

We should also expect joy.

Verse 11, I'll read it again.

These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full.

The joy of the Lord is our strength.

It's funny when that scripture that it's in neither Ezra and Jeremiah or Jeremiah.

Blanking off the top of my head.

That scripture in its context is Israel is saying that and they don't have the Torah.

They don't have the scripture.

They don't have the I guess it'd be the Pentateuch, the first five books of the law.

They've lost it.

They don't have it.

And then they get it back.

And what do they say?

The joy of the Lord is my strength.

The joy of the Lord is his word.

The joy of the Lord is there is his command.

It's his.

It's amazing.

Joy.

Joy is not the absence of fear, but the presence of God.

We should expect joy.

We should expect hatred.

In my notes, I wrote down, get over the what will they think about me thoughts.

Get over the what will they think about me thoughts.

I was talking about this the other day.

I was we were down in Charlotte.

We were at a park and there's these two moms are meeting together and whatever.

And Kayla just starts like talking with them.

I'm like, this is weird.

She's like talking to these two random moms.

And she just like starts to get to know them and start talking about life, talking about stuff.

And I was like, I was because she'll come she'll come home sometimes and be like, yeah, I met this girl at the park, whatever, yada, yada, yada.

And this is the first time I've really seen it in action.

And I was like, whoa, this is this is she just has such a way of like just like throwing herself out there.

And the reason I bring that up is because I wish I did that more.

I wish I interacted with with people more.

I wish I threw myself out there more.

And for me, specifically, one of the reasons I don't is because like, well, what if they reject me?

And how often have I missed opportunities?

And it's not like I'm going to lead someone to Jesus right there in the moment in the in the in the pasta section at the grocery store.

But how often do I miss moments to connect with people, to leave an impact on people, to just encourage someone?

Because I'm I'm too worried about what people will think of me like that is that's first off, that's incredibly selfish.

But also, I'm I'm missing opportunities to just be a light.

How like if somebody came up to you, whether you're at the grocery store, you're at your work and somebody just like, man, you're just doing such a great job.

How impactful would that be?

Like, I don't know if you've ever experienced that before, where somebody just comes up to you and just says like, man, you're you're crushing it.

You're doing a great job.

And you're like, oh, thank you.

An old pastor always said, people can never be too encouraged.

And yet, I hold back because I'm so worried of what people would think about me and how silly as it sounds, especially when we're talking about we like we're looking at Jesus, they hated me.

Like, yeah, people still hate Jesus.

And I'm over here afraid to talk to someone in the grocery store like and you go like, well, I can't man.

That's like, how do I fill that gap?

That is such a big gap.

Well, it starts with you just like actually doing the thing that you're afraid of doing the thing that you're worried about.

Get over the what will they think about me thoughts?

We should expect joy.

We should expect hatred.

We should expect persecution.

Now, we don't welcome persecution.

We don't want to welcome persecution.

Be like, come on, bring it on.

I read this story the other day of this church in Seattle.

And I'm trying to make a long story very short.

Anyways, they were trying to do some like worship in the park event thing and the city turned down their permits twice for two different parks.

But then they offered up this one park, which Seattle, very inclusive, very accepting.

Thank you.

And they the park that they gave them was kind of at the hub of this sort of LGBTQ community, so on and so forth.

And they were like, are you sure you want us to go to this park?

Like, we're going to worship.

We're going to like express ourselves.

And they're like, yeah, go for it.

So word gets out this event's happening and protesters show up like gangbusters.

The church was there.

They were giving out haircuts.

They were, you know, giving out groceries to the community, just doing things that churches usually do.

All these protesters show up.

And I think it was like the protest protesters were throwing water balloons that were not filled with water.

They were filled with urine.

They were like just doing all these hate, like just terrible things.

Some of the protesters eventually like attacked people.

One tried to run and get up on stage like just like.

Wild.

And then the mayor of Seattle goes, it's all the church's fault.

They shouldn't have had this event.

They shouldn't have exercised their first member rights, whatever.

We don't have to get into the political side of things.

We don't have to get into any of those things.

But I bring up that story.

To say.

Persecution happens.

Yeah, that's in America.

But did you know that like.

There are people getting.

Killed and murdered.

Around the world right now simply for confessing in Christ.

We all know about the underground church in China, how there's meetings there.

I just heard a story of a pastor and a group just a couple of weeks ago.

They went to I can't remember the country off the top of my head.

And the authorities heard that there was this pastor gathering.

It was this pastor from America helping them kind of like structure some of their discipleship stuff and different things.

And it was hundreds of church leaders all gathered in this place at this at this building.

And police showed up.

They scattered everyone, all these things.

And the pastors from America, they had to go into hiding in this country.

And.

The.

The pastors all in that are from the country and the surrounding areas.

All were like, hey, can you still meet with us?

And so the American pastor was like, I mean, sure, if you guys still want to do this thing, let's do it.

And so a couple of days later, they all gather and they all had the they all had the meeting and it all went to plan.

And the American pastor got out of there.

But that's the the church.

Still doing what Jesus said would would do and happen.

A bravery and a relentless pursuit in the midst of persecution, in the midst of.

Craziness.

Who knows what would have happened with that American, with those other with those other pastors?

And that was like weeks ago.

I'm not talking like years ago, like weeks ago.

We should expect joy.

We should expect hatred.

We should expect persecution.

And boy, do we have it.

Kush in the Bible Belt.

But if we do not understand that Jesus has said those things and not only said them, but live them out himself.

When those things come.

Well, we let the circumstances from life.

Disrupted.

You are my friends if you do what I command.

No longer do I call you servants for servant does not know what his master is doing.

We know what Jesus did.

And he has called us friends.

We matter to Jesus.

You matter to Jesus.

Your life matters to Jesus.

What you do Monday through Sunday matters to Jesus.

And he's commanded you to go and bear fruit.

He calls us friends.

He has given us his spirit, verse 26 and 27.

But when the helper comes whom I will send to you from the Father, the spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.

And you will also bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning.

When the helper comes and how ironic that we're reading this passage on the day of Pentecost, 50 days after the resurrection of Jesus, the spirit has come.

The spirit of truth.

And he bears witness about Jesus.

And we will also bear witness.

He calls us friend.

He has given us his spirit.

And Jesus has prepared us for his mission, verse 16.

You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit.

Jesus chose you to go and bear fruit.

So get over the what will they think about me thoughts.

Understand persecution can happen.

But understand that the joy of the Lord will be in you and with you.

That the presence of the Lord through his spirit will never leave you.

And that Jesus calls you friend.

He's chosen you and he's appointed you to go and bear fruit.

Would you pray with me?

Jesus, we thank you for your word.

We thank you.

You spoke to your disciples even before you went to the cross.

How impactful they are to us today.

We thank you that your word is true.

We thank you, Father, that we can keep in your love.

Not because we can do it on our own, but because you have come to us.

Thank you for your commands and help us to love one another.

We pray that we'd be filled with your joy.

We pray that we would be willing to step out to be a light.

Thank you for calling us friend.

Thank you for giving us your spirit.

Thank you for giving us a mission to follow.

We love you.

It's in Jesus name.

Amen.
