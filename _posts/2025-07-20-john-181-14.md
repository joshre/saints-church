## Transcription

Let's jump back up to the top of this chapter here, and it says, "...

He went out with His disciples across the Brook Kidron, where there was a garden, which He and His disciples entered.

Now Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with His disciples." So here's a little map of the garden and the locale.

So we see it's on kind of the bank of the Mount of Olives, and if you were wondering where Olive Garden got their name, Olive Garden, sorry, stupid joke.

So this was the spot where Jesus went to this garden.

Again, lots of olive trees, and they're used to be there, no longer.

Lots of olive trees, lots of, yeah, it's a, I mean, a Mount of Olives, and there's this garden there in the midst.

If you remember before the Upper Room Discourse, Jesus is out in Bethany, and again He heals Lazarus and all those things.

It feels like such a long time ago when we looked at that passage.

But it was out in Bethany, which is just, you know, a mile or so outside of the city, and that was kind of Jesus' home base whenever He would go to Jerusalem, and was in Bethany.

And we could see that all throughout the Book of John.

But Jesus doesn't go there because it, if you were a good Jew and a proper Jew, the Jewish law required that observing Jews remain within a certain radius of the temple of Jerusalem in, during Passover.

So they had to be within a certain amount of, there was a certain city limits in which they needed to be in to be, to practice Passover, to go through everything for Passover.

So it, and this place, the perimeter included the garden but did not include Bethany.

So, that's probably why Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane, was to stay within city limits, since, of course, He was the law-abiding citizen.

And also, this was probably a spot that He went to regularly, right?

Like, Judas went and met them there, so He, this was probably a spot that Jesus often retreated to.

And, uh, so then verse 3 tells us, So Judas, having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons.

Um, and when we look at the other gospel accounts, there are a few details that John doesn't give us of this whole scene right here, and some that he does give us.

So, uh, John does not include Jesus' time of prayer, where he is with his disciples, and he says, Okay, hey, you guys, you guys pray.

We're going to go pray.

I'm going to go over here and pray.

You guys pray as well.

And, uh, Jesus goes and prays.

And at that time, we see throughout the other gospel accounts, we see Jesus is, uh, comforted by an angel, we see Jesus is, uh, sweating what's like drops of blood, we see Jesus is praying and asking, like, God, if, if there's any other way, like, take this cup from me, but not my will be done, but yours be done.

And we see those things happen as Jesus is praying.

And we also see Jesus go back to the disciples, and they fell asleep.

They did not pray, or like Jesus was praying, they, they fell asleep.

Uh, and, but we do see, again, and that happens multiple times, Jesus is, he goes and returns them a couple times, and they fall asleep each time.

Um, and so, Jesus is praying, and all those things happen, but John doesn't give us any of those details, but what John does tell us is that there were a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests.

So, uh, a band of soldiers back in Roman times, a full band or company of soldiers was 1,000 men.

Uh, it was divided into 760 foot soldiers and 240 cavalry.

So, that's what a proper company or band of soldiers looked like.

Um, now, in practice, uh, it, I was reading it said, it usually looked like 600 men and anywhere down to 200 men.

So, John tells us there's this band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests.

So, if, you know, it could have been up to 1,000, anywhere down to 200 men going to capture Jesus along with these officers and chief priests.

Now, whenever I pictured this scene in my head, I did not picture, let's just go on the, on the small side, because that's still a lot of people.

Let's say it's 200 people that went to go capture Jesus.

In my head, it's not that many people, but that's what John tells us.

Judas procured a band of soldiers.

There's a ton of people going to get Jesus.

Again, that, that band of soldiers, in practice, it could be up, proper, it's 1,000, all the way down to 200.

So, a wide range of manpower, but nonetheless, a lot of manpower.

And again, these aren't like, you know, like, go, like, rent-a-cop kind of soldiers.

This isn't Mall Cop.

This is not, uh, uh, Larry the Mall Cop.

I can't, I can't remember his name.

Paul Blart.

Paul Blart, the Mall Cop.

This is not, this is not him.

These are Roman soldiers.

These are, like, the U.

S. military.

This is, like, bad-to-the-bone kind of officers going to get Jesus.

This, then let's continue, I just, I just kind of marvel at the extreme number of people sent to go get Jesus.

Again, this is, like, this is Jesus.

Verse 4 tells us, Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, Whom do you seek?

They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.

Jesus said to them, I am he.

Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.

When Jesus said to them, I am he, they drew back and fell to the ground.

It's so interesting to me, seeing how you have this huge group of men, these Roman soldiers at that.

And who is the one controlling the conversation?

Who's the one that's setting the table?

It's Jesus.

Jesus, he says, he says, Whom do you seek?

Who are you looking for?

What is, like, what are you looking for?

And Jesus says, I am he.

And Jesus uses this word, I am he, which in the Greek and multiple times throughout the gospel, we see Jesus use this phrase, I am.

And this, that phrase would have been linked all the way back to Jesus, or all the way back to Yahweh, back in, back, of course, Old Testament.

And he's using this word, I am.

I am the good shepherd.

I am the bread of life.

I am the way, the truth, and the life.

Jesus says, before Abraham was, I am.

And again, in front of these Roman soldiers, in front of these Pharisees, in front of the Jewish officers, he says, I am he.

And what is their response when they hear, I am he?

They drew back and fell to the ground.

They drew back and fell to the ground.

Again, this phrase, I am, it would have been reserved for God and for God alone.

The way Jesus said it, the word he used, ego emi, would have been used for God and God alone.

And so, Jesus uses this expression that in this Jewish context, would have been reserved for God, and the people respond by falling, by drawing back and falling to the ground.

We cannot say for certain why exactly they responded the way that they did, but it's probably because that phrase, that the way, the ego emi, that wording was used specifically for God and God alone.

And so, the response was, we're in the presence of God.

They fall to the ground.

Verse 7, So Jesus asked them again, Whom do you seek?

And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.

Jesus answered, I told you that I am he, so if you seek me, let these men go.

This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken.

Of those whom you gave me, I have lost, not one.

Jesus' concern in this moment was not the cross ahead.

Jesus' concern was not the cross ahead.

His concern is protecting his sheep, his disciples.

And again, Jesus prayed in chapter 17, that none of his sheep would be lost, and here he is protecting them.

But Peter, verse 10, Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear.

The servant's name was Malchus.

So Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword into its sheath.

Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?

Peter, what a guy.

What a guy Peter is.

He's just messing things up, left and right.

Again, John doesn't include this, but in the other Gospels, we see as Peter strikes this man's ear, it falls to the ground, Jesus picks it up, and then just puts it right back on the man's, on Malchus' head.

So, that's pretty cool.

But it's funny, in my study, what I came to see is that, the text says sword, right?

And I don't know about you, but when I see sword, when I think sword, I think, you know, medieval sword, like a big sword, like I think the sword of Gryffindor, that's what I think of, is a big, it's a big sword.

Well, that's not the kind of sword that Peter was carrying around.

It was probably more like a dagger.

It was like a concealed carry sword, right?

Like, it was not a big sword.

And so, Peter has this dagger, and he's probably aiming for the head, and just missed, barely, and strikes his ear.

And, Jesus is like, Peter, put your chef's knife away.

Like, this is not, this is not that kind of party.

He's like, I'm trying to get you out of here all clean and easy, safe, don't worry about, like, I'm trying to get you out.

I'm trying to get you good.

And, you're over here trying to cut this man's ear off, and you're, you had one job, Peter.

Just chill.

Just chill.

Then Jesus continues to say, verse 11, put your sword into its sheath.

Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?

Now, this, we could easily kind of breeze past the cup, that phrase that he used, shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?

And, of course, we've, we've read the story, we know the story, we know the cup that's ahead is the cross.

But, what we might be missing is the, the, the depth and the, the power of that phrase.

Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?

The cup refers to death and it also symbolizes God's wrath.

The cup refers to death and also symbolizes God's wrath.

Let me show you.

Psalm 75 says, For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup with foaming wine well mixed and he pours out from it and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.

Shall drain it down to the dregs.

So there's this cup for the wicked that's in the hand of the Lord.

So there's, there's judgment.

There's, there's wrath.

Then, Isaiah 51 says, Wake yourself, wake yourself, stand up, O Jerusalem.

You who have drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of his wrath.

Who have drunk to the dregs the bowl the cup of staggering.

So, the cup that Jesus takes for you and me is death and the wrath of God.

The cup that Jesus takes for you and me is a cup of death and the wrath of God.

Verse 12 tells us, So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.

First they led him to Annas for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was high priest that year.

It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.

In verse 14 we get this kind of callback to a previous chapter, John 11, which we'll read in a second.

But verse 14 tells us, It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.

Let's read that passage again so we can be re-familiarized with it.

John 11, 49 says, Caiaphas who was the high priest that year said to them, You know nothing at all nor do you understand that it is better for you that no man should die, that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.

He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one, the children of God who are scattered abroad.

So from that day on they made plans to put him to death.

And here we are chapters later, days, months later seeing that plan come to fruition.

As I was preparing for this message and kind of thinking of how I wanted to close the message, there were a couple different ways I could have I saw it.

And then the one that I kept coming back to and kept honestly being reminded of, being encouraged by, is this idea right here.

God is in control.

God is in control.

Right?

Like, look at Jesus.

Goes out to this garden.

He arrives first to the meeting.

The meeting that starts His sureness of going to the cross.

He arrives first.

He controls the conversation.

As we read through the entire chapter, it's not just Jesus in this moment, but all throughout these different meetings, whether it be with the high priest, whether it be with Pilate, He's kind of controlling the conversation.

He's giving, He's not giving the answers that will get Him free.

He's giving the answers that will lead Him to the cross.

Jesus willingly goes before each court, confident in who He is.

With Pilate, what do they, so you're the King of the Jews?

If that's what you say, I am.

He goes before the court confident, knowing what He was supposed to do and what He was sent to do to accomplish.

And Jesus was in control then and He is in control now.

And of course, this morning we see Peter doing what Peter did and doing what you and I constantly do. we constantly act like Peter, flailing our dagger, trying to willpower our way through life circumstances, whether we like them or not, trying to play the cards our own way to get the outcome for which we want and desire.

And what does Jesus do?

Well, for Peter specifically, He heals the man's ear.

For you and I, not only does He heal our eternity, but He's also given us grace abundantly and given the Spirit inside of us to enable us to live and be called according to His purpose and somehow works all things together for the good of those who love Him, tells us in Romans 8.

For Peter, He healed his mistakes.

For us, He heals our mistakes.

And then Jesus takes this cup of death and wrath of God that we deserve and Jesus takes that for us.

See, Jesus is in control.

God is in control.

Now, I'm not saying we just sit back and do nothing and just kind of let go and let God.

There are some things, some circumstances where we actually do need to let go, and let God, but He's also given us agency and ability to control what we can control.

But the question I have is, how are you at controlling what you cannot control?

How are you at controlling what you cannot control?

See, we have the agency and ability to control the things that we can control, but then there are things that are outside of our control.

Sometimes good, sometimes bad, sometimes ugly.

And do we spend all of our time focused and fixated on what we cannot control?

Or are we looking at the things that we can control and being obedient to God with those things?

Now look, I don't want to make this all about us because that is not what we see in the scriptures, but two, I want us to keep turning our attention to Jesus, who again willingly took the cup for us, who willingly took the wrath of God upon a cross to die.

And this was not easy to do.

Again, in the other gospels, it tells us he was sweating like drops of blood in these moments.

He was praying, God, if there's any other way, take this cup from me, but not my will be done, but your will be done.

The other gospel accounts tell us that Jesus was being ministered to by an angel.

That's how serious these moments are.

That's how big these moments are.

And he did this for you, and he did this for me.

And what is Jesus doing now?

He is sitting at the right hand of God, being worshipped for what he has done, what he is continuing to do in and through us because of the Spirit that he and the Father sent for us.

Let me remind you, my friend, that God is in control.

God is in control.

He always has been.

He always will be.

And when we look at the cross, yes, it's terrible what Jesus had to do for you and for me.

It's terrible seeing him be berated in front of these different courts.

Him being passed around from court to court to court. but he was not doing that with an inability to call down angels, with an inability to just do whatever he desired to do.

No, this was what he desired to do and what he planned to do.

And so we can look at the cross with triumph, with gratitude. seeing that he willingly took up the cross.

He willingly went there for you and for me.

Why?

Because God is in control.

He is in control.

Would you pray with me?

Jesus, we thank you that you are God, that you are good, that you knew what you were getting yourself into.

And we thank you that you did not just come to earth at age 30 and do your ministry and then say, alright, let's get this over with quick.

Let's just go to the cross so I can pay for sin and I'll get back up, ascend back up to my rightful seat at the right hand of God.

No, you willingly were born as a baby.

You willingly grew up.

You willingly went through puberty. 30 some odd years of life so that we could see how great, how mighty, how powerful, how much love you have for your people.

And not just the Jews, but all those who later would come to faith in you.

We thank you Jesus for that sacrifice.

We thank you Jesus that you willingly took up the cross.

Let us not become too normal with the cross.

Let us not take for granted the cross, what you went through on the cross.

And Father, as we walk through these next few chapters where we see your trial, your beating, your death, and your resurrection, let us not just breeze over those parts quickly.

Let us see your might and your power.

We love you God, and we thank you for this morning. may we be reminded how big you are and how much in control you are and help us to be faithful stewards with what you have given us.

We love you, we praise you, and it's in your name.

Everyone said amen.

Amen.
