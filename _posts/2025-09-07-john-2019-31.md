<p>Jesus appears to his disciples and Twin Thomas. </p>

## Transcription

And this morning we, I mean it's been quite a journey honestly, through this book here and we have a few more sermons through this amazing book of the Bible and I will clear some of your worry and anxiety as you're wondering what are we going to next?

We will actually be just continuing on into the book of Acts and as John ends, Acts begins, at least that's how they formatted it in the scriptures and so that's where we're going and we're going to go pretty slow through the first two chapters and then about from chapter three on we're going to try our best to do a chapter a week so it'll be a little more, we'll move a little quicker and move a little more swiftly and but today our text has a few things to say so let's jump into John chapter 20 and we will be reading verses 19 through 31, 19 through the end of the chapter so if somebody wants to read that aloud, John chapter 20 starting at verse 19 through the end of the chapter.

Bueller?

Go for it, yeah sorry.

Wait what did you say?

I said Bueller.

It was just a stupid movie reference.

When he had said this, he showed them his hands and decided and the disciples were glad that they saw the Lord.

Jesus touched them again and keeps them with Him as the Father has said to me, even so, I intend to heal.

And when he had said this, he breathed on their own and touched them, received the Holy Spirit.

If you forgive the sins of the Lord, they are forgiven.

If you would hold forgiveness for many, it is your fault.

Now Thomas, one of the twelve called the twins, was not with them when Jesus came.

So the other disciples told them, we have seen the Lord.

But he said to them, a laugh I see in his hands, the mark of the nail, I place my finger in the mark of the nail and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.

And when the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among the disciples.

He said, then he said to Thomas, put your finger here and place my hand.

And put out your hand and place it in his side.

Do not disbelieve, but believe.

Thomas answered him, my Lord and my God, Jesus said to him, have you believed because you have seen me?

Now Jesus did many other signs which are not written in the book.

But you know written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have a blessing in the name of God.

Awesome.

Yes, it works.

So on the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors were locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews.

Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, peace be with you.

Last week we looked at the morning of Jesus' resurrection and our text starts on that same day, that same Sunday in the evening and the disciples were there.

And if we were to look ahead in the text that we all just read together, it would mention how Thomas was not present and so because of that assertion we could assume that the 10 others were there in that room with the door locked and the disciples were afraid.

And again for fear of the Jews, why?

Probably because the Jews just killed Jesus and so they were probably thinking we are next.

For whatever reason in this scene in this scenario, the question popped into my head, what would you do if zombies became a thing?

That's what popped into my head.

And you see these guys, they're fearful and they go and lock the door.

Anyways, the text tells us here a few things.

So somehow Jesus came and stood among them.

We get the understanding that the door was locked.

So did Jesus knock on the door and they opened it?

Did he just appear?

Like last week we talked about On the Road to Emmaus and Luke chapter 24 how Jesus broke the bread and then they realized it was used and then he vanished.

Was it like he just appeared and then reappeared or disappeared?

Did he just float through the door?

We don't know.

We don't know.

But John tells us that the door was locked and then Jesus came.

At any rate, Jesus says to them, Peace be with you.

That's a very common phrase that you would hear in 1st century Jews.

And even to this day, you could hear a Jew saying to another Jew or even maybe sometimes to you, Shalom al-Khan.

That means peace be with you.

That's what they would have said.

And so why would John include this phrase twice in these couple verses but then three times in the whole passage that we just read?

Why would John mention this?

And I think it's because on two separate occasions in the Uproom Discourse, again that's John chapter 13 to about John chapter 17, 18.

Jesus, he talks about peace.

And this is what he says.

He says, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you, not as the world gives, do I give to you.

So Jesus is our peace, correct?

Right?

Like we were at war with God.

Jesus comes, live a perfect life.

He is our, he is everything.

He is our peace.

And Jesus brings peace to the war between us and God.

Jesus brings peace and reconciliation to the Father by his life, death and resurrection.

Right?

That was the sacrifice for our sins so that we could have peace with God.

And so I think that's why John is mentioning that Jesus says, that Jesus says, Peace, like peace be with you.

Like hey, I did all this so that you could have peace and like we're at peace now.

Verse 20 continues, when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side, then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.

Jesus said to them, Peace be with you as the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.

Now Jesus shows the disciples his scars and reminds them of the peace of the Father.

And then he says to them, as the Father has sent me, so I am sending you.

And this is John's version of the Great Commission.

And again, this is something that John points out even before the cross.

He says in John chapter 17, verse 18, he talks about sending.

And here, again, Jesus is saying it after the cross.

Like I told you this before and I'm telling you again, as the Father has sent me, so I am sending you.

I was sent to bring peace and you have it.

Now go on behalf of me and share the message that I gave to you.

And then we get this highly debated passage, verse 22, 23.

And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.

If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them.

If you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.

Now like I mentioned, this passage is debated and there's many opinions on the interpretation of this passage.

And we're not going to sit here and go through the many opinions.

And so I'm just going to kind of give you the main idea of the argument.

And this is kind of the question that people bring up about this text.

If Jesus is giving the disciples the Holy Spirit here, what's up with the Day of Pentecost?

Like if the disciples already had the Spirit here in this text, then why was there a need for Pentecost?

We're not going to get into this.

You can go look it up for yourself if you so desire.

But I will just give you what I believe the remedy around all the arguing is.

Jesus is being symbolic here.

And just breathing on them in some sense is an active parable pointing forward to Acts chapter two.

Just like when Jesus washes the disciples' feet in John 13, was a symbolism of him washing their sins away.

This is the same thing just with the Spirit.

Now, I want to take a step back here and also interpret verse 23 in light of verse 21.

So verse 21 says, Jesus said to them again, peace be with you as the Father has sent me even so I am sending you.

Don't worry about 22.

Jump down to 23.

If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them.

If you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.

Jesus was sent for our salvation.

And Jesus is sending his people to spread the gospel.

The good news of Jesus Christ which brings salvation and the forgiveness of sins.

And to steal from our Catechism from last week since we are redeemed by grace alone through faith alone.

Where does this faith come from?

From the Holy Spirit.

So as the apostles will go and declare the gospel, they are bringing the forgiveness of sins with them.

Why?

Because it is the spirit in which allows people to come to faith and forgive sins through our belief in Jesus.

So again we are interpreting verse 23 in light of verse 21.

The whole reason Jesus mentions this and John mentions this is because, let's think of the sending.

And as they forgive the sins, it is a declaration of the gospel that forgives sins and receiving the gospel forgives sins.

And that's what the apostles were called to do and that's what we are called to do.

Let's continue.

Now Thomas, one of the twelve called the twin was not with them when Jesus came.

So the other disciples told him, we have seen the Lord.

But he said to them, unless I have seen his hands, the marks of the nails, and placed my finger into the mark of the nails.

And placed my hand into his side, I will never believe.

Now, we get this assertion from John and Thomas is called the twin.

Which for what it's worth, I like twin Thomas much better than doubting Thomas.

I think that has a much better ring to it.

Twin Thomas, you know, it's got the little alliteration there.

They both start with T's versus doubting Thomas.

And also, I'm not trying to start a debate or anything, but the text doesn't say that Thomas doubted.

It just says he doesn't believe.

So, unbelieving Thomas, twin Thomas is much better.

At any rate, so Thomas was missing that Sunday evening when they were all together and Jesus appears to them.

And then it tells us, gives us this sort of addition that somewhere within that timeline, the 12 go to Thomas and be like, Yo, we saw Jesus, like this is awesome.

He's alive.

And Thomas is like, no, I have to see it.

I have to put my finger in his wrists and see the stabbing of his side.

And then I will believe.

Well, eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them.

And although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, peace be with you.

There it is again.

Then he said to Thomas, put your finger here and see my hands and put out your hand and place it in my side.

Do not disbelieve, but believe.

So a few days later, Jesus shows up again and again, we get another mentioning of the doors being locked and he came there standing and saying, peace be with you.

And then he says to some Thomas, put your finger here, see my hands, put out your hand and place it in my side.

Do not disbelieve, but believe.

Now, the text doesn't tell us what Jesus was doing within those eight days.

If one of the disciples had went and found Jesus within that time period and said, hey, Thomas is saying this about you, dude.

Like, what are you going to do about it?

We don't know that.

We don't know if Jesus just knew, right?

But whatever the circumstances was, Jesus says, hey, bro, check this out.

And the text also doesn't tell us if Thomas actually put his finger into Jesus' wrist or into his side.

But what it does tell us is Thomas answered him, my Lord and my God, my Lord and my God.

Thomas gives the greatest confession anyone could give to Jesus.

The word Thomas uses here in the Greek is theos, which when the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew into Greek, it's the same word that they use for Yahweh or Adonai or Elohim when they're talking about God.

So Thomas is equating Jesus to God.

This word was not taken lightly.

We are so desensitized whenever people, we hear people say, oh my God, all the time.

We hear people say, take the Lord's name in vain all the time.

And so it's almost a nothing burger to us.

It's just like, you hear it.

It reminds me of Ted Lasso.

And every time they cringe when they talk about Danny having the yips, if you know the show, remember what happened with Danny kicks a penalty kick and the penalty kick ends up killing this dog anyways.

And then he has the yips all after it.

And they don't want to say the word.

They don't want to say Danny has that and they're like, no, no, no, no, shh.

They make a huge deal about it.

That's what it would have been like if you were a young Jewish boy and you're playing your video games, and then you go, oh my Elohim, your mom would break down the door and be like, what'd you say boy?

She would freak out.

Thomas is making a serious claim about God.

He is saying Jesus is God.

The claims that Jesus made all throughout his ministry, I believe it.

And what does Jesus say to him?

Have you believed because you have seen me?

Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.

Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.

And here we are again in the South.

We hear the word blessed all the time.

Man, I'm just so blessed.

How are you doing?

Blessed and highly favored.

God really blessed us with these amazing UT tickets.

We're just so blessed by this weather.

We use it for everything.

And like, yeah, sure, some of those things are great.

But we have lost the biblical sense of blessedness.

Here's a very simple definition, primary meaning of blessedness.

Blessedness is to be looked on favorably by God.

Blessedness is to be looked on favorably by God.

It has more to do with the disposition or the character of God than our feelings and circumstances.

Do you understand how blessed you are?

Do you understand how blessed you are?

That you believe in Jesus Christ and not only that, but what that means because of your belief?

Your eternity is set.

Your eternity is secure because of Jesus.

If you believe in Jesus, you are blessed.

God looks so favorably upon you.

Why?

Because he doesn't see you for your sin.

He sees you for the sacrifice of Jesus.

That is being blessed.

Jesus gave his peace to you simply because you received salvation.

You didn't do anything for it.

That is the favor of God.

That is the blessedness of God.

You don't deserve any of it.

But it was the mercy and favor of God that he has blessed you.

And this is the whole reason John wrote this book of the Bible.

The whole reason John was writing this letter, not for his pleasure, not for the miracles, but he wrote this book so that you would believe.

Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book.

But these are written.

He goes, I hand selected these miracles.

I hand selected the stories and the things that I'm telling you so that you would believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

The whole thing is about believing.

So the question is, what do you believe about Jesus?

What do you believe about Jesus?

Does your belief in Jesus give you life in his name?

And of course it brings eternal life.

But remember, Jesus says in John 10, I have come that they might have life abundantly.

This isn't prosperity gospel talk.

This is just straight up truth.

Jesus didn't come for you to be stuck in your sin, your bad habits, your anger, and your negative disposition.

Remember, you're blessed.

God looks favorably upon you.

Again, we must not think health, wealth, and happiness, although those things are not bad either.

But no, may the spirit of God transform us, not for our sake, but for his.

So that we don't have to be stuck in our sin.

We don't have to be stuck in bad habits.

We don't have to be stuck in anger.

We don't have to be stuck in lust.

We don't have to be stuck in worry, and anxiety, and negative disposition.

No, you are more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus.

So that you can be sent out into your world to be light in the darkness, to be a loving witness of Jesus and his kingdom.

Jesus came that we would have life and life to the full, or life abundantly.

So the question is, how do we do that?

I shared this at our prayer gathering this last week, and it fits in this moment as well.

And so we're going to go back to it, just because I think it's a lovely passage, and because I got the mic.

Hebrews 12, it says this.

This is the very end of Hebrews, and the author has written so much, talking about how Jesus is a high priest, and how the promises and covenants that Jesus fulfilled, and all these things.

And so he's making the case for Christ, and Christ alone, and the author here, at the end of Hebrews 12 says, Therefore, let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken.

And thus, let us offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.

And if you're there in your own Bible, which you can turn there if you would like to, because we're going to keep reading, and it changes into a new chapter, but of course we have to remember that chapters and verses were added later.

And so originally in the text, the author writes this, Therefore, let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.

Let brotherly love continue, he says.

So believing in Jesus is believing in an unshakable kingdom.

Right?

His kingdom conquered hell, death, and the grave.

And so what do we do about that?

We offer acceptable worship to God.

What is acceptable worship?

And then he tells us what that looks like.

Let brotherly love continue.

Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.

Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body.

Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be under filed, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.

Keep your life free from the love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you.

So what is acceptable worship look like?

Let me grab my pen here.

It looks like brotherly love, right?

It looks like loving our neighbor.

It looks like showing hospitality to strangers.

Because sometimes when we're hospitable to the stranger, when we're hospitable to the person who's homeless on the street corner, and we buy them a sandwich, sometimes we might be entertaining angels.

Man, I wonder how that would just kind of change our perspective on how we treat people on a day-to-day basis.

I could be entertaining angels.

And not that we worship angels, not that we think that angels are more higher than us, or greater than us, but we would treat them like we would treat a fellow brother or sister in Christ.

He says, remember those who are in prison.

And of course, if we think back to the first century church, there literally would have been believers who would have been put in prison for their faith.

And so the writer here is going, hey, remember those who are in prison, remember those who are in the church, but are not with you.

It makes me think of the Frasiers.

They're not in prison, they're in Florida.

We might be the ones in prison, actually.

But like, are we checking in on the people that are in our bodies that are not with us?

I try my best if you miss a Sunday to check in on you, and just say, hey, we missed you.

Why?

Because you're supposed to be here with us.

This is the whole point of church and community, is to be around each other, to be with each other, to be for each other, to support each other, to be there for each other, to pray with each other.

But also, we have to care for the marginalized, right?

Like, it says, remember those who are in prison, and of course that's the context, but also we should care for those who are in prison.

Verse 4, let marriage be held in honor among all.

I think one of the most devastating things about our Christians, and Western US Christians today, is that the divorce rate is the same, if not worse, than those who don't believe.

That should be something that differentiates us.

And yet, here we are, living to worldly standards.

No, we should have great marriages.

Why?

Because...

Well, one the text tells us to, but also our marriage is supposed to look like Christ and His church.

That's the metaphor that we see in Scripture, that Christ is the head of the church, just like a man is the head of a woman, and it's as bright.

And let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.

Sex should be between a husband and a wife, no one else.

Keep your life free from the love of money.

I forgot to underline these here, so some of you guys are... you missed those verse 4, whatever.

Keep your life free from the love of money.

How do we do that?

We're generous.

We give.

We give.

We give to the church.

That's why our church gives.

Because it's not just about us.

Because we want to see our community changed, so we partner with different missions organizations.

We want to see the world change.

That's why we have missionary partners that we support financially.

Because it can be easy to love money.

And so, we're generous.

With our money.

We be content with what we have.

We, our lives should be lives that are filled with gratitude.

We should be grateful.

Why?

Because you said, I will never leave you nor forsake you.

We don't have to worry about that.

Why?

Because the Lord is with us.

He will never leave you.

He will never forsake you.

So yeah, of course I can give generously.

Of course I can live within my means.

I can be content with what I have.

I should have a marriage that honors the Lord.

I should be caring for the people in my church who are with me, who are with us, as well as our way.

And I should also be caring for the marginalized.

And I need to show hospitality to strangers.

And I need to let brotherly love continue.

I need to love your neighbor.

And again, this is not from a place of earning salvation.

These are just markers of what it looks like to truly follow Christ.

If you believe in Christ, then the fruit should be easy to see.

And so what do you believe about Jesus?

Do you see?

Can you see these traits in your own life?

And again, this isn't a measuring stick.

But can you see some of these things?

Oh yeah.

Yeah, I'm doing a good job of loving my neighbor.

I'm being hospitable to the stranger.

My marriage is honored.

And maybe you're here in this moment and you go, Man, I actually don't think I see those things in my life.

Well, then would you begin with praying to God and saying, God, would you convict me?

Because I don't want to do these things to earn, to act like I'm earning my salvation.

I know I already have that.

But Lord, I want my life to reflect my beliefs.

Would you begin to show me where you desire me to change?

That's the prayer I want for you this morning.

Lord, would you show us where we fall short?

Would you show us how we can become better followers of you?

And again, this is not for our salvation.

We thank God that you sent Jesus to do all of that for us.

But as Jesus, but God, as you sent Jesus, so you are sending us.

And actually, as we finish this morning, I actually want to pray this scripture over you.

This is the end of Hebrews.

There's actually some verses afterwards, but this is kind of closing prayer.

In Hebrews, he says, Now, may the God of peace, there that word is again, may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant.

May he equip you with every good work that you may do his will, working in us, that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.

Thank you for watching.

Thank you for watching.
