## Transcription

A couple of announcements for us this morning before we dive into the text.

We have a few kids left on the Christmas tree that we need to sponsor.

And just to remind us all there, we are partnering with a ton of local churches here in the neighborhood.

And our goal is to sponsor children who are in the foster care system and about 800 will go without Christmas presents.

That's confirmed through their, well we're blank me, through their foster parents and their social worker.

That's the word I'm looking for, thank you.

Confirmed through them that they will go without a present under the tree.

And so us and a bunch of other local congregations are coming together to fill that gap and care for the orphan.

And so on the little Christmas tree that's on the table out there, there's a few tags left.

And the presents are due next Sunday.

That's one week from today.

And would you bring the Christmas presents back next Sunday?

And the presents can be unwrapped and one big bag per child.

It could be a gift bag.

It could be, you know, a box even.

Just so that it's easier for us to kind of divvy up and make sure that.

So one big bag per child.

So Luke gets a bag.

Jesse gets a bag.

Jethro gets a bag.

Jessica gets a bag.

Oh, she's not even, oh, they're in there.

So on and so forth.

Jeff gets a bag.

Jesus gets a bag.

Jesus gets a bag.

Then, so Christmas tree.

Check out their tags.

Let's get all of our children that we've been allotted for.

Let's get them taken care of.

And those are due next Sunday.

Then a prayer gathering this Wednesday, 7 o'clock.

We're continuing with the names of God that we see in Scripture.

And that's all I'm going to give you.

You're just going to have to come and find out and see which one we're going over.

I'm really excited for it as I was prepping for it.

It was a good time of prayer for me, myself, and I.

And so would you please join us this Wednesday?

And we can all pray together and not just be me.

This morning, we're covering Acts chapter 6.

It's a short chapter.

And the chapters that follow just get longer and longer.

And so we'll consider this a warm-up lap for the next few weeks.

But we're going to focus in on these first seven verses in Acts 6.

Let's see.

Am I live?

Oh, there we are.

Yay!

I love it when it comes together.

Okay, Acts 6.

We're going to focus in on these.

We'll focus in on the first seven verses and then take the chapter from there as well.

I will read it for us and then we'll jump in.

Now, in these days, when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.

And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, It is not right that we should give up preaching the Word of God to serve tables.

Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty.

But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.

And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Procurus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicholas, a proselyte of Antioch.

And these they sat before the apostles and they prayed and laid their hands on them.

And the Word of God continued to increase, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.

And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people.

Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the freedmen, as it was called, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and those of Silica and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen.

But they could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking.

Then they secretly instigated men who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.

And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council.

And they set up false witnesses who said, This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law.

For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us.

And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw his face was like the face of an angel.

Okay, so like I said, we're going to focus in on these first seven verses, and we'll spend some time on the later verses.

But let me pray for us.

Thank you, Jesus, for your word and the spirit for your works through your church.

Would you teach us this morning?

In Jesus name.

Amen.

Okay, verse one.

Now, in these days, when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.

Hellenists, these are Jews whose primary language was Greek, not Aramaic.

That's the distinction here when it says Hellenists.

These are believers, and this whole group of believers are in Jerusalem, and the local Hebrews most likely would have spoken Aramaic.

The Hellenistic Jews would have been from out of town.

The diaspora is what they would have been called.

And the scattered Jews around the Roman world at the time.

That's what the diaspora was.

These scattered Jews from around the Roman world at the time.

And they spoke Greek.

They probably understood both languages, but their primary language was Greek.

And the locals were looking after their own and not necessarily caring for these Hellenistic Jews.

But I want us to notice here right out of the gate.

The disciples, or the believers, were growing in number, and they're experiencing growing pains.

A complaint arose, right?

That's what it says.

A complaint arose.

And in the words of Notorious B.

I.

G., Mo' money, Mo' problems.

Okay?

That's kind of the thing we've got going on here.

Mo' people, Mo' problems.

And it's a great lesson for us today.

As we grow, as our church grows, there will be more problems.

Not because there's a specific issue, but because more people, more problems.

We all bring our baggage wherever we go.

There's an old preacher saying that goes, If you find a perfect church, don't join it.

Because you'll mess it up.

Right?

Like, there's no such thing as a perfect church.

There's no such thing as perfect people.

We're all broken.

We're all sinners just trying to help each other stay focused on what Christ has called us to do.

Amen?

So these Hellenistic Jews, they feel like their widows are being neglected in the daily distribution of money or food or both.

We don't get the specific details of what they're distributing.

But they were getting shorted.

So the apostles, the twelve, they call together the first church member meeting.

Right?

Verse 2.

And when the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables.

Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you some seven men of good repute, full of wisdom and full of the Spirit, whom we will appoint to this duty, but we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.

So the apostles set up this church meeting and say, Hey, we know there's some issues here within the church.

We know these are important issues.

We want to take care of these issues.

But we do not want to neglect what God has given to us, what Jesus has given to us.

We do not want to stop preaching and proclaiming the gospel.

That is what Jesus has told them to do.

So they come up with a plan.

Hey, you guys, nominate seven good men, full of the Spirit and wisdom, who the apostles will appoint for the job.

But the apostles made their role very clear.

But we will devote ourselves to prayer and the preaching of the word.

I want to make this very clear.

I am your pastor.

That is clear.

I am your pastor.

I am the pastor of this church, but I am not an apostle.

The apostolic window has closed.

It has ceased.

However, when we look at this passage and this situation from the early church, what can we take away here?

The number one job of a pastor today is to preach and to pray.

We see that here.

We will see that also throughout the New Testament.

The number one job of a pastor today is to preach and to pray.

Are there other things I can do and should do?

Yeah, for sure.

But the most important role of the apostles then and a pastor now is the proclamation of the word of God and prayer.

That is what we see here in this story.

And the apostles were firm.

They could not give up their first job and task of preaching and praying.

And so they asked the people to nominate some godly men to serve.

And when it says serve tables, this isn't like, you know, they're serving at the cheesecake factory.

They're not a waiter or a waitress.

That's not what their job here is.

Most likely when this is mentioned, it's referencing the money changing tables where a money changer did his collecting and exchanging of money.

So these men were elected to oversee the distribution of the monies and other provisions to the needy among the church, among the believers.

This was not the apostles saying we are above this work.

It's like, oh, I'm a pastor.

I cannot set up chairs.

I cannot do that.

That's not what this is.

Oh, I'm a pastor.

I can't serve coffee.

That's not what this is saying.

They're not saying that they are above this work.

They are saying it's important and it must be done.

And also we have other work to be done.

And we can tell that the church was in agreement by the way that they responded.

And what they said pleased the whole gathering.

It pleased them.

They were stoked.

They're like, sick.

Let's go.

We like this plan.

We're all good with this.

Ready?

Break.

Run the play.

So the church elected these seven men.

And, of course, the text focuses in on Stephen because of what will happen in the following chapters.

But we'll get to that next week because it's chapter 7.

But anyways, how about verse 7?

And the word of God continued to increase, and the number of disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.

So not only did these actions please the church, but it also led to more growth.

The number of the disciples multiplied greatly, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.

What's going on here?

So do a little research, a little digging.

Jewish historian Josephus, he says there were about 20,000 priests at the time.

Others would argue that number all the way down to 2,000, but at any rate, 20,000, 2,000, somewhere in between.

You could pick your number.

I don't really care.

A wide range, but a notable number of priests.

They had other jobs, along with being a priest, except they served in the temple for about two weeks a year.

And so a great many of the priests became obedient to faith in Jesus at this time.

We don't have that specific number of how many joined, but the text tells us that many priests came to faith.

And so that's pretty cool.

I thought that was cool.

But what do we see from the early church here?

What are some takeaways we can take from the early church?

The priority of church leaders is focused on prayer and proclamation of the gospel.

I've already kind of made that point at length, and so we've seen that in the text.

The priority of the church leaders is focused on prayer and the proclamation of the gospel.

Second point that we can take away from the early church is that care starts within the church.

Care starts within the church.

What do we see?

The church is caring for their brothers and sisters in Christ.

So what can we take away from that?

If you need some kind of resources, if you need help relationally, and we the church aren't helping you with that, we're letting each other down.

And this doesn't just fall on the pastor, as we see in the text.

It didn't just fall on the apostles.

But it's on all of us.

The phrase, church hurt, gets thrown around a lot these days, and sometimes valid.

But sometimes, I believe that it is unsaid expectations leading to unmet results.

And that's, if I were to give my two-second summary on church hurt, that's what I think it is most of the time.

Some of the time.

I'll be generous.

Some of the time.

So first and foremost, have you voiced where you need help?

If you are in need, if you are part of our church, if you are part of a church, and you need help, have you voiced where you need help?

If that's a no, then you've got to tell somebody.

You don't have to tell everybody, but you do need to tell somebody.

Talk to me.

Talk to an elder.

Talk to somebody.

We can't help you if you come in here every week, and when somebody asks you, how are you doing?

And then you just say, good.

Yeah, good.

Everything's fine.

We're good.

How about you?

Oh, did you get a coffee yet?

Like, if that's the sum of your conversation on a Sunday morning, one, not only are you missing out, but two, you're not allowing the church to do its job.

The church as a whole.

We are not mind readers, but we all love to fake it.

We all love to fake it.

We all love to act like we've got it all together.

We all like to come in here and be like, no, man, we're good.

It's fine.

Yeah, we just had an argument in the car, and we're pulling into church.

Good morning.

Yes.

Good morning.

Yes.

Good.

Praise God.

Hallelujah.

Blessed and highly favored.

No.

We want to seem like we've got it all together, but we all know that's not the truth.

So why are we acting like it?

Care for the church starts within the church.

If we cannot care for each other inside of this body, how do we expect to grow outside of it?

But you need to voice your concerns.

I think we all know if somebody needed help, we would help each other.

We'd all be there.

Boom.

It doesn't matter the time.

It doesn't matter what's going on.

We would help however we could.

That's just...

I mean, I've seen it with every single one of you.

But we can't help if you don't tell us how you need help.

And I'm not saying you need a five-point plan.

I'm not saying you need to have it all figured out.

I need help here, here, and here, and here, and here.

And where can you help me?

That's not what I'm saying.

But you need to...

You need a voice.

Hey, I've got help here, and I'm not...

I don't even know where to start.

I'm also not saying we're gonna...

You tell us you need help, and then we're just gonna throw money at an issue just to solve a problem.

But if we get those things out, man, that's a huge start.

So the priority of...

Takeaway from the early church.

Priority of the church leaders is focus on prayer and proclamation of the gospel.

Care starts within the church.

The other takeaway I see is growing churches are characterized by diversity, unity, and complications.

Truthfully, our culture and society love diversity, right?

Like, diversity is our strength.

We hear that all the time.

Which can be true.

But if I were to be a spectator at our culture and our society, I would say that diversity has become an idol, not a strength.

Which we all know idols are not strong.

And so since it's becoming an idol, it's become a weakness.

But if we're looking at the text, we do see some diversity amongst the Jews here in this passage.

And of course, this is mainly lingual diversity, right?

Because the church has not gone outside of Jerusalem yet.

Which we will, when we add Gentiles, eventually we'll get there.

But we also see this lingual diversity, but economic diversity.

And of course, eventually, the Gentiles will be added to the church.

But we're not quite there yet in Acts chapter 6 or in Acts at all.

But how many of us also know growth is not linear, right?

There's ups and downs, there's challenges and hardships.

But we see in these seven verses, the gospel is continuing to advance.

Like we talked about last week, Jesus is protecting his bride and building his church.

And so, growing churches are characterized by diversity and unity and complications.

So, if we see these things, if there's diversity, if there's more unity, and if there's complications, that's good.

It's like if I were to be talking to a couple and they're like, no, everything's great.

Like we never fight, we never, there's no issues, there's no problems at all.

And I'd be like, uh, first, either you're lying or you're delusional or both.

There's complications come because we're people.

Okay, let's jump to the next section of verses.

Verse 8.

And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people.

Okay, so, I love this.

The last chunk of verses was about serving the church, right?

And then, what does Luke mention Stephen doing?

Great wonders and signs among the people.

And then, if we were to turn to Acts chapter 7, we would see Stephen start to preach.

So, this whole little summary and section here, the verses prior, is all about serving the church.

But then, what does Luke continue to write about?

Signs, wonders, and proclamation of the gospel.

It's like, crazy to me.

It's almost like the whole point and purpose of Acts is talking about the proclamation and spreading of the gospel.

It's like Luke was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is the thing.

But like, the important thing is the preaching and proclamation of the gospel.

Verse 9.

And then, some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the freedmen, as it was called, and of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians, and those from Silica and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen.

They could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking.

So, they were coming for Stephen.

And he was just, you know, we don't know if they were asking questions, if they were saying X, Y, and Z.

And he was just running circles around them.

They just couldn't stop him.

They could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking, as it says there in verse 10.

And so, verse 11 tells us, Then they secretly instigated men who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.

And they were stirred up, and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council.

And they set up false witnesses who said, This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law, for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us.

This is a classic case of if you can't beat him, lie about him.

They couldn't stand with Stephen in a debate.

They couldn't talk to each other.

And so they start stirring up lies and bring false witnesses.

And what do we see from this first interaction with Stephen?

He does not back down from the truth.

This is now the third time that the Jews are combating the Christians.

And Stephen just doesn't back down.

He is confronting them with the truth.

And when they are confronted with the truth, what is their response?

Let's get rid of them.

Let's stir up lies.

Let's stir up false witness.

We'll see in the next couple chapters he's going to be stoned to death.

But Stephen, even in the midst of death, does not back down from the truth.

So my question to you, my question for us this morning, is how do you respond to the truth?

How do you respond to the truth?

What truth?

How do you respond to the truth of who you really are?

If we were to look at this story, we would love to see ourselves as Stephen.

We would love to see ourselves as the person who is, you know, the hero and eventually the martyr.

This is the person who stands up and does the right thing and is all, it's like, yeah, stick it to the man.

But if we were to be honest, we'd probably find ourselves on the other side.

We would find ourselves to be with these Pharisees and scribes and elders who just, who could not stand what Stephen was doing, what this early church was doing and how they were, they're taking our people, what's going on with all these Jews converting?

What, what is happening?

We would be enraged.

And then I was reminded of this verse in Genesis chapter 6.

The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

Dang.

If we were to look at this text in context, it's right, right before the flood.

So that's what's coming after these words and after this verse.

But just like sit with that text for a moment.

I don't know about you when I, but when I think of like evil in a person's heart, I'm thinking like serial killer.

I'm thinking like worst case scenario, like man, those, murder, just, I'm thinking terrible things.

Terrorists, just, you know, all the bad things.

And I go, I'm not that bad.

Like, look at this person.

They just killed a bunch of people.

That's terrible.

That's evil.

I don't have evil in my heart.

That's not who I am.

No, I'm a good person.

On whose standards?

I might be good on my own standards, but I'm not good on God's standards.

To God, I am wicked and I am evil.

The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

I am evil and wicked.

I am evil and wicked.

You are wicked and evil.

The truth of who you are, the truth of who I am, is wicked and evil.

And thank God that he did something about that.

Stephen in this next chapter will confront the Israelites again with the truth of who they are and what they've done to Jesus.

And although we are not there in the text and we are reading the story 2,000 plus years later, it was our sin that he died for.

We are the Israelites who convicted and killed Jesus.

Our sins bring about death.

But thank God for his son Jesus who took our sin upon him so that we could become the righteousness of God.

That is the truth that we are wicked.

Every intention and every thought is only evil.

God's ways are not our ways.

His thoughts are not our thoughts.

He is right and we are wrong.

And may we respond to the truth and remember and recognize that the answer is not in ourselves, but the answer is in Jesus Christ.

And may he, through the Holy Spirit, transform our thoughts and minds so that we could be shaped in the image and likeness of the Son.

We need Jesus.

And I know you know that.

But do you also know who you are?

We are only good because of Jesus.

His work.

Not your own.

Would you pray with me?

Jesus, we thank you for who you are.

How you have saved us and are changing us.

We ask that you would help us see ourselves for who we really are.

So that we can see you for who you really are.

The Savior of the world.

Thank you, God, for what you have done to draw me near to you.

I do not deserve what you've done.

And help me to more purely worship you because you deserve it.

Holy Spirit, would you speak to us?
