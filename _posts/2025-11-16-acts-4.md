## Transcription

If you missed last week, and I would encourage you to jump on over and check out the podcast.

You can get it pretty much wherever you listen to podcasts.

And it was great.

Evan preached a great message on Acts chapter 3, and if you did miss last week, we started, usually we teach verse by verse, and we started this last week going chapter by chapter through the book of Acts, and so we were in Acts 3 last week, so that means we're in Acts 4 this week.

In Acts 4, we find ourselves in the middle of a story, which that story started in Acts chapter 3, and so let me briefly catch us up.

Let me tell you what happened in Acts chapter 3.

I'm not going to give you everything, because if you missed the message last week, well, go and listen to it, and we're not teaching on Acts chapter 3, we're in Acts chapter 4.

So, how it'll work this morning is, we'll read once through it, and then we'll read it again, and we'll kind of camp out in certain verses.

I guess that's what we typically do, but usually it's just like 3 to 5, or sometimes 10 verses, and this time we're going to do more than that.

So, Acts chapter 3, we see a miracle.

A lame man, he gets healed.

Acts chapter 4 will tell us that he'd been lame for 40 years.

He's about 40 years old, and so 40 years he's gone to the temple, sitting outside the temple gate, and been begging.

And then Peter and John walk by, and Peter famously says, I do not have silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

Get up and walk.

And then the man gets up and walks, and everyone is amazed, and then Peter preaches a message, and proclaims the gospel, and people come to repentance.

And then that's where we kind of pick ourselves up here in Acts chapter 4.

And if somebody wouldn't mind reading Acts chapter 4, we will go from there.

Acts 4.

Bueller.

And as they were speaking to the people, the priests, and what happened at the temple, and the statutes came upon them, greatly annoyed, because they were teaching the people, and proclaiming Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

And they arrested them, and put them in custody, and for the next day, for it was already evening.

But many of those who had heard the word believe, and the number of the men came to be about 5,000.

On the next day, the rulers and elders and strides gathered together in Jerusalem.

With Annas, the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and all who were of the high priest's communion.

And when they had set the name in the night, they inquired, By what power, or by what name, did you do this?

Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders, if we are being examined today concerning good deeds done for a crooked man, by what means this man has been healed, let it be known to all of you, and to all people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ is not there, and you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by whom this man is standing before you were.

This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders which have become replenished ones, and their salvation, and no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among them, by which you must be paid.

Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished, and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.

But seeing the man who was still standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition.

But when they had commanded them to leave the castle, they conferred with one another, saying, What shall we do with these men?

For that a notable sign has been performed through them as evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.

But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.

So they called them and charged them not to speak their teeth at all in the name of Jesus.

But Peter and John answered them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must say.

For you cannot but speak of what you have seen and heard.

And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened.

For the man on whom the sign of healing was performed was more than 40 years old.

When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the two priests and the elders had said to them.

And when they had heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, and through the mouth of our Father David, his servant said by the Holy Spirit, Why did the Gentiles rage?

And the people fought in heaven.

The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and the people of his and the king.

For truly in this city, they were gathered together against the Holy Servant Jesus, who knew and wanted both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel.

To do whatever your hand and your plans and predestines took place.

And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to your servants to continue to speak their words with all boldness, while you stretch out your hand of guilt, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your Holy Spirit and Jesus.

And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was taken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.

Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the kings that had belonged to him was his own.

But they had everything in common, and with great power the apostles were given with testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.

And great grace was upon them all.

And there was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands and houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of what was sold, and laid it at the apostles' feet.

And it was distributed to each as any had need.

Thus Joseph, who was called by the apostles Barnabas, between son of Improving, a Levite, and native of Cyprus, sold a field that belonged to him, and brought the money, and made it at the apostles' feet.

Awesome.

Thank you.

All right, some of the verses will be on screen, others won't, so make sure you keep your text there in front of you.

We're going to jump right back up to the beginning.

And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, greatly annoyed, because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was about already evening.

But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about 5,000.

So the result of Peter's, of this miracle that Peter performed, and Peter's message, is them first getting put in prison, can't brush past that one, but also we see 2,000 more were added to their number, bringing the total to 5,000.

We see 3,000 come to faith at Pentecost, and then about 2,000 now, which makes 5,000, and that's how math works.

So I'm told.

Verse 5.

On the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high priestly families.

Do these names ring a bell?

Annas and Caiaphas, they started the trial leading to Jesus' crucifixion.

They were part of the governing body called the Sanhedrin, and this was like the equivalent of the Supreme Judicial Council of Judaism.

So like the Judaism's Supreme Court, if you will.

It contains 71 members, and that's who Peter and John are in the midst of in this moment.

They're in front of the Sanhedrin.

Annas, Caiaphas, they get mentioned because they're the leaders.

One was Rome acknowledged that person as leader, and the other was the actual high priest.

Rome wanted to install their own high priest, and so there were two high priests, even though really there should be one.

But at any rate, that's where we are right now.

Verse 7.

And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power or by what name did you do this?

Verse 8 starts, Then Peter filled with the Holy Spirit.

I want you to take a mental note of this in verse 8.

Filled with the Spirit.

We're going to come back to that.

Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders, If we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed, let it be known to all of you and all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him this man is standing before you well.

This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.

Peter in verse 11, he's quoting Psalm 118, verse 22.

And Jesus himself actually quotes this scripture in one of his parables found in Mark 12.

And Jesus was the fulfillment of this specific Old Testament prophecy and Messianic prophecy and all Old Testament Messianic prophecy.

And Peter, who should be on the defensive right now, right?

He's standing in front of the Supreme Court.

He's standing in front of these 71 officials.

He who should be on the offensive is, or on the defensive, should be defending his case, is actually on the offensive.

He says, you guys crucified Jesus.

He's, he's accusing the religious leaders of missing the prophet and fulfilling this Old Testament prophecy that you guys, you builders, you've rejected and you've missed the chief cornerstone.

Which, if we look at the Old Testament, this is kind of par for the course for the Israelites.

They were always missing what God wanted and intended.

And I would actually suggest that we might actually be in that boat too.

We might not have missed Jesus, but we do a pretty good job of selecting which parts of his word we want to follow.

Verse 12, and there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men, which by we must be saved.

This statement here in verse 12 was quite radical then, and it's still quite radical now.

Of course, it wouldn't be radical in the sense of there being one God, but the fact that Peter is declaring and saying in front of the Jews that no, Jesus is God, that would have been radical.

And it's radical now because we live in a world that hates exclusivity.

Especially if you're on the outside looking in of that exclusivity.

But this is the truth.

And Peter didn't come up with this on his own accord.

No, he was first, he's filled with the spirit.

And secondly, he's only repeating what he heard Jesus say.

John 14, 6, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

No one comes to the Father except through me.

So, Peter's like, yo, I've, I've witnessed this guy, Jesus.

I've seen this guy, Jesus.

I, I saw him perform miracles.

I saw him proclaim the truth like nobody ever had, nobody ever knew, nobody ever heard.

And they were all witnesses of that.

And Nicodemus, in fact, said it himself.

And, then he died and resurrected.

And then he told me to be a witness.

And now I'm filled with the spirit.

And I'm proclaiming truth that before I would have cursed Jesus.

And now I'm actually telling you guys that you're under a curse.

This is the Peter that's talking here.

And he's just simply repeating the words that he heard Jesus say that I am the way.

I am the truth.

I am the life.

And no one comes to the Father except through me.

And I think when Jesus says no one comes to the Father except through him, I think Jesus actually means no one.

Verse 13, Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were uneducated common men, they were astonished.

And they recognized that they had been with Jesus.

What a statement.

They recognized that these men had been with Jesus.

They also recognized that they were common ordinary men.

They were not the elite.

They were not super educated.

They were not super wealthy.

But they recognized that they had been with Jesus.

Is that what people say about you?

Okay, let's carry on here.

Verse 14.

But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition.

Now I want you to think and imagine you're one of these Sanhedrin fellow.

You worked so hard a few months ago to kill this guy Jesus.

You worked so hard.

Like, all you wanted to do was get rid of Jesus.

You just wanted to go home and enjoy Passover like the rest of the Israelites.

That's what you wanted to do.

That's what you were just dead set on it.

And then you get these two jabronis, Peter and John.

Uneducated, regular dudes.

Just a bunch of Joe Schmoes.

And they are schooling you.

You are on the Supreme Court of the Jews.

And these guys are taking you to school.

Quoting scripture.

Talking about Jesus.

Talking about his miracles.

Talking about all that he's done.

And you're one of these Sanhedrin guys.

And over the last 50 or 60 or so days, you've gotten to sleep with ease because you killed Jesus.

You got rid of Jesus.

You got rid of the guy.

And now you're hearing rumors and murmurs of, he might have actually raised from the dead.

We can't find him anymore.

He's nowhere to be found.

And then, 40 days later, then, or 50 days later, and then you hear of all the chaos that's happening on Pentecost.

And then, here we are a few days later.

We don't have an exact count of how many days it was post-Pentecost.

But it probably wasn't too far after Pentecost.

And now these guys are healing the lame man that's been sitting there for 40 years?

Oh, man.

What a mess.

Your worst nightmare.

Verse 15, But when they had commanded them to leave the council, they conferred with one another, saying, What shall we do with these men?

For that a notable sign had been performed through them as evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

And we cannot deny it.

But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.

So the council gathers and they say, Peter and John, you're dismissed.

Just go sit outside the doors.

The grown-ups are going to talk for a minute.

The council, they're like, What do we do?

What do we do?

Then one of the guys speaks up and goes, Hey, I've got a really bad idea.

How about this?

We tell them.

They cannot speak about Jesus anymore.

I think this is going to work.

I think we got them.

Verse 18, So they called them and charged them to not speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.

But Peter and John answered them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge.

For we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.

What is a witness?

A witness is someone who sees an event.

That is what a witness is.

What did Jesus say to his disciples before he descended into heaven?

Acts 1.8 You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria to the ends of the earth.

And what are the Jewish leaders saying to Peter and John here?

Don't do that.

Don't be witnesses.

I don't want you don't say anything about what don't mention Jesus what you saw him do what you heard him say don't mention it.

Just shut up.

And what's the response?

Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God you must judge for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.

They are saying we have to speak about what we've seen and what we've heard.

This reminds me of the prophet Jeremiah in Jeremiah 20.

The prophet Jeremiah says if I say I will not mention him or speak any more in his name there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones and I am weary in withholding it in and I cannot.

This is what they are saying.

They were filled with the spirit to preach and proclaim the gospel.

That is what they witnessed.

That is what Jesus had told them to do.

That is what they were called to do.

That is what they've been asked and commanded to do.

So should we obey you or the man who we saw rise from the grave?

What shall we do?

Verse 21 continues and when they had further threatened them they let them go finding no way to punish them because of the people for all were praising God for what had happened for the man of whom this sign of healing was performed was more than 40 years old.

The religious leaders they couldn't do anything.

There was no way to stop them.

No way to shut them up within reason.

Verse 23 when they released them they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and elders had said to them.

So they get back to their fellow believers and it's story time.

What happened?

We saw you guys get taken into prison.

What happened?

What happened?

And so they they tell them.

But notice the response of their fellow believers and when they heard it they lifted their voices together to God.

They began praying and praising and worshiping God.

And when they had heard it they lifted their voices together to God and said Sovereign Lord who made the heaven and the earth and the seas and everything in them who through the mouth of our father David your servant said by the Holy Spirit why did the Gentiles rage and the people's plot in vain?

The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his anointed for truly in this city they were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place and now Lord look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness while you stretch out your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus so the early church their prayer here is rooted in Psalm chapter 2 and if we return to Psalm chapter 2 we would see that the prayer in Psalm chapter 2 and the prayer of the disciples the prayer of the apostles they differ so they took the beginning of Psalm chapter 2 but then the apostles pray way differently in fact I'll tell you so in Psalm 2 the psalmist they pray that God may laugh at the Jewish leaders that's verse 4 in Psalm 2 and terrify them with his wrath and break them with an iron rod or dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel so that they perish that's all in Psalm 2 they do not pray that the apostles here they do not pray that the threats of the Sanhedrin may be revoked or may be proven harmless they do not pray that they may be spared opposition or suffering or execution no that's not what the apostles pray here in Acts 2 they pray that God would look at their threats and that God would intervene on their behalf we just read in verse 21 that the Sanhedrin continued to threaten them so there were continual threats until they finally released them and then we see in the prayer in verse 29 here it says and so now Lord look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness do you hear that difference there in Psalm 2 the psalmist was wanting wrath and terrify them and make them laugh make God laugh at them but the believers here ask God to be concerned about their threats so that they may face the opposition of the Jewish leaders with courageous faith to their calling of course to be witnesses of Jesus and so their prayer here is that God would look upon their threats then secondly the petition of the believers is that they're praying for the continued courage to preach and teach the gospel right the gospel is what they have been given and they are asking God to give them boldness to proclaim it and then the last petition of the disciples is here in verse 30 that God would cause healings and signs and wonders to happen they pray for further healing to happen which is leading to further opportunities to proclaim the good news of Jesus the Messiah and Savior so very different prayer very different they kind of started they took the beginning of Acts 2 and was like yeah we're going to make our own spin on it let's continue on in verse 31 and when they had prayed the place in which they were gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with all boldness God heard their prayers and answered their prayer how often do we pray for certain things and then when God gives it to you we like complain about it like oh like man I asked for an opportunity to share my faith to you know to talk to bring you up in a conversation with this person that I've been wanting to and then the opportunity comes and you're like how about the weather let's read verse 32 now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own but they had everything in common and with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all there was not a needy person among them for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold and laid it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to each as any had need thus Josephus who was also called by the apostles Barnabas which means son of encouragement a Levite a native of Cyprus sold the field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet so Luke is again making the point that the transforming power of the Holy Spirit and the grace of God create a community of believers who are united in a common faith and a common purpose who selflessly share their material resources with needy members we're going to talk more about that next week when we get to chapter 5 but I will ask you to put your house on the market I'm just kidding as we close here I want to ask and hopefully answer a question that as I was doing my study it just kind of like popped out on the page it's mentioned multiple times in this chapter and the question is what what does it mean to be filled with the Spirit what's it mean to be filled with the Spirit that phrase gets thrown around a lot today but I want to look at this chapter as well as all over in the book of Acts being filled with the Spirit is the power to boldly declare the resurrection of Jesus Christ being filled with the Spirit is the power to boldly declare the resurrection of Jesus Christ when we look at Acts we see this phrase filled with the Spirit all over of course Acts chapter 2 is Pentecost where they boldly declare the mighty works of God in all the languages we see it multiple times here in Acts 4 Acts 9 we see that phrase filled with the Spirit again and when Ananias lays his hands on Saul who will later become Paul and he is filled with the Spirit then in Acts 13 Paul and Barnabas confront a false prophet named Bar-Jesus and they are filled with the Spirit as they condemn him and then at the end of chapter 13 it's mentioned yet again as Paul and Barnabas are leaving town after getting kicked out because they were in town spreading the gospel proclaiming the gospel now to further back up this point I want us to fall back to Acts chapter 4 right Peter and John are in front of the Sanhedrin and Jesus actually has some words about this all the way back in Luke 12 Jesus says and when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and authorities do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself for what you should say for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say that's Jesus back in Luke 12 and so Jesus says the Holy Spirit will teach his apostles and what happens when Peter and John are in front of the rulers and authorities they are filled with the Spirit and boldly declare you killed Jesus you miss Jesus in fact the psalmist wrote about how you would be the you would reject the stone that would to that is to be the chief cornerstone now I'm not saying that this is an exclusive definition of what it means to be filled with the Spirit but if your definition does not include boldness to proclaim the gospel then let me submit to you to think again I heard a story the other day about a kid who went to the pound and he got a new dog and the dog was a mutt and just you know just a bunch of different kinds of dogs all put into one and his neighbor goes oh hey I see I see you got a new dog what kind of dog is this and then the kid goes it's a police dog of course usually police dogs they have a certain look they you know they're a certain breed and the neighbor goes oh awesome yeah and then the kid goes he's in the Secret Service I wonder how many of us are in the Secret Service nobody knows you're a Christian none of your co-workers the people you interact with on a daily basis they have no idea you're a Christian I saw a video the other day and it was a this person and he was on campus at Penn State and he was going up to athletes and they had Bible verses in their Instagram bios and he would like find the certain athlete and then he would ask him hey do you know what this Bible verse says and I'm like three fourths of them had no idea they couldn't remember but like it's in their Instagram bio you think you could at least memorize that one it's like okay what's going on here see I think you and I we have the opposite problem of Peter and John and so let me ask you in plainer language are you filled with the spirit is is there any boldness in you to proclaim the gospel if not I would hope and pray that your prayer would actually start to turn and look like the prayer of the early disciples in verse 29 where they say and now Lord look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness the issue is here is what kind of threats do we face I mean we pray before UT football games in this great state there are no threats what COVID oh the government shut down our services was that's the biggest threat that we have we've mentioned a few times the persecution and the tragedy that's been happening in Nigeria this year alone there have been 7000 Christians killed in Nigeria and I want to show you a picture of a church gathering after their after their church and some of their homes and fields were burnt down and for for what it's worth this picture is actually from 2023 let me let me read you the details of this picture after being attacked by militants on the Easter weekends of 2021 and 2022 a Christian farming community in north-central Nigeria's plateau state gathered to worship God again on Good Friday of this year 2023 the worshipers numbers about 300 persons including adults children and senior citizens most were seated on the floor others on stones the few who could afford it sat on plastic chairs that they bought for themselves 2023 and we're just hearing about the tragedy in 2025 and yet this article mentions in 2021 this farming community persecuted for years and still showing up the article goes on to talk about how they worship in the rain the pastor has suffered from pneumonia he's contracted hepatitis but he is still passionate to preach the gospel these folks are filled with the spirit church may I implore you to get out of the secret service my goal is to not to condemn you or to make you feel bad I'm trying to wake you up to the reality of how good we've got it go introduce yourself to a neighbor go talk to that co-worker initiate a conversation you don't need the words the spirit will give them to you our world is too broken and our message the gospel is too good for us to be silent our world is too broken and our God is too good for us to not be people who are bold witnesses and so are you filled with the spirit would you pray with me God would you fill us with your spirit put people in our way to boldly proclaim the gospel help us to be witnesses of what we've seen and heard we have seen you save us we have seen you transform us let us boldly proclaim your life death and resurrection to the ends of the earth it's in Jesus name everyone said amen
