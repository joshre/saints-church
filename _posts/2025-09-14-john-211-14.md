  <p>After a night of empty nets, Jesus meets his disciples with a miracle, a meal, and a message of restoration. In John 21:1–14, we see how Christ meets us in our shame and calls us back to himself.</p><p><br></p><p>In this sermon, we’ll explore:</p><ul><li>Why Peter’s shame matters, and what his actions reveal about the weight of sin and guilt</li></ul><ul><li>How Jesus shows himself through repeated acts of grace, not just appearances</li></ul><ul><li>What it means to recognize Christ in seasons when we can’t hear his voice clearly</li></ul><ul><li>The practices—Scripture, prayer, gathering with the church, and fasting—that draw us nearer to him</li></ul><ul><li>The invitation to run toward Jesus with all our brokenness, trusting that he is ready to serve, restore, and call us forward</li></ul>
