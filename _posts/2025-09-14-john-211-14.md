## Transcription

If we were to kind of look at all the different themes and things that John has been teaching throughout This gospel, especially this coming to a close, right?

I mean like if we look at the last few verses of John chapter 20 the purpose of this book now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples Which are not written in this book, but these are written so that you may believe That Jesus is the Christ's son of God and that by believing you may have life in his name, right?

That's the last verses in John chapter 20 and So that kind of that would be like a nice end to the To the letter to the story that John has played out for us except He hasn't yet Tied the bow he hasn't yet Completed the story of Peter and so that's what we see throughout almost all of this whole chapter is Peter is John Closing the book dotting the dotting the eyes and crossing the teas For Peter.

Oh Simon Peter.

I guess he's got an eye and a T.

I did anyways.

Okay, let's jump in verse 1 After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the sea of Tiberius and he revealed himself in this way Simon Peter Thomas called the twin there is again twin Thomas what I tell you last week Nathaniel spelled incorrectly of Cana and Galilee the son of Zebedee and two others of his disciples were together So again, we will see this is the third time in John where Jesus reveals himself to the disciples So we've got Peter twin Thomas Nate dog Zebedee the sons of Zebedee, which are James and John and two other disciples who Whoever they are they weren't worth naming so Sucks to be those guys.

I guess you were this close to make it into the Bible, but At least you made it to heaven verse 3 Simon Peter said to them I'm going fishing.

They said to him we will go with you.

They went out and Got into the boat But that night they caught nothing Yes Simon said to the gang I'm going fishing we've been sitting around here for a while I just need something to do If you have a friend who just like can't just like chill on the couch all day needs to get up and go do something I'm not looking at some of you in this room but Peter's like I I can't see her any longer like I got to go fishing and They all follow but it was a rough night of fishing.

I've I feel like I've heard this setup before I feel like I've this this is starting to sound familiar Okay, verse 4 just as day was breaking Jesus stood on the shore yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus Jesus said to them children do you have any fish?

They answered him no he said to them cast the net to the right side of the boat and you will find some So they cast it and now they were not able to haul it in because the quantity of Fish so if we were to take a step back and look at the full context that John 21 gives us Jesus is about 100 yards off of the Of the shore so about a football field in length and our text says children that Jesus calls out to them children do you have any fish and That Jesus is probably saying something more along the lines of like fellows or gentlemen or if you ask me he's like my dudes you got any fish and Again, I feel like I've heard this before I've heard this before it in in the Gospel accounts, I've heard this kind of setup before And they replied no and Jesus tells them to cast our nets to the other side again We've probably all heard this before this is all stuff We've heard and seen Jesus do before with the disciples and in fact if we were to turn to Luke chapter 5 and this is early on in Jesus's ministry and it tells us in Luke chapter 5 on one occasion while the crowd was pressing in on him to Hear the word of God.

He was standing by the lake of Cassandra.

So again, these are two different stories This is not the same place see a Tiberius see of Cassandra And he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone Out of them and we're washing their nets again to these are two different stories Getting into one of the boats which was Simons He asked him to put it to put out a little while from the land and he sat down and taught the people from the boat And when he had finished speaking he said it was him Simon put out into your into the deep and let down your nets for a catch And Simon answered master master.

We toiled all night and took nothing Didn't we just read that obviously different, but you know what I mean?

But at your word, I will let down the nets and when he had done this They enclosed a large number of fish and their nets were breaking they signaled to their partners and in the other boat to come and help them and They came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink But when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus's knees saying depart from me for I'm a sinful man Oh Lord for he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had Taken so this is again Luke chapter 5 This is when Jesus first calls some of these disciples in a very similar scenario in a very similar situation And so the disciples are here are here with Jesus in John chapter 21 And all these things and the text tells us that they catch 153 fish why the exact number who knows but it's a lot of fish for these first century nets Verse 7 continues and tells us that disciple whom Jesus loved John said to Peter It is the Lord when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he put out He put on his outer garment for he was stripped for work and threw himself into the sea So John elbows Peter and he's like dude.

That's Jesus Side note Have the voices near our head ever been so loud that you could not hear the voice of God Simon or John elbows Peter It's almost like Peter was I don't know so in the zone or whatever Was taking Peter at least an extra moment that John had that Give him one of these to be like dude.

That's the Lord Then John gives us this really interesting note on Peter's actions He does the exact opposite of what most of us do when we're about to jump into the water Peter puts on his outer cloak What do you usually do when you get in or going to go into the water?

You take off your clothes And here Peter is doing the opposite.

Why does John give us this?

Give us this detail.

I cannot say for certain, but I believe John is trying to fill us in on some of what Peter is feeling on some of what Peter is feeling On some of what Peter is is going through now.

Let me take us back To Genesis Adam and Eve they take a bite of the fruit They feel shame and they recognize their nakedness and what is Peter in this moment doing?

He's probably feeling shameful.

We know later in the text that tells us he's grieved and what does he do?

He covers himself He covers himself But Yet Peter He does not run away from Jesus.

He runs towards Jesus Peter feels shameful for his actions And and as we will see later in the chapter there is resolution But there is not any yet So we cannot go there yet because we we don't want to sit in this Uncomfortability between Peter and Jesus.

We want to jump to okay, but they're all good.

They're all good We we like resolution.

We like that, but we're not there yet.

So don't go there yet There's not any yet.

So don't give that to Peter yet He's in his fields and he covers himself and yet he jumps into the sea and he threw himself towards Jesus I Just want to take a moment and say in the midst of this week in the midst of all of the devastation and the terror That has happened all over our country this week in the last couple weeks What do we need to do as a country?

What do we need to do as a people and as the church?

Shame and all we need to run towards Jesus.

We need to jump out of the boat And start swimming towards the sea where Jesus is what is the remedy for pain?

What is the remedy for death?

What is the remedy for brokenness?

It's jesus He's the only one who saves and he's the only one who can fix this brokenness in our world Who can fix the pain who can fix death?

Jesus is the only one and so as people in the midst of our shame in the midst of whatever you're going Through here now in this moment.

We need to run.

We need to jump in the water towards Jesus He's the only one that can fix anything where we are helpless without him The other disciples were say came in the boat dragging the net full of fish For they were not far from the land about about a hundred yards off So while Peter is swimming to shore The rest of the boys they're rasslin this 153 group of fish When they got out on land they saw a charcoal fire in place with fish Layed out on it and bread and Jesus said to them bring some of the fish that you just caught So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore full of large fish 153 of them and although there were so many The net was not torn Jesus said to them come and have breakfast Verse nine when they got out on land they saw a charcoal fire in place.

Does this sound familiar?

Is this ringing a bell?

John chapter 18.

Peter denies Jesus During his trial around a charcoal fire and yet here John mentions again a charcoal fire John is just dropping all kinds of Easter eggs all over but let's not get caught up in those things Let's remind ourselves of Jesus's actions.

What is Jesus doing here?

He is feeding his sheep.

He is feeding and serving his disciples Here is the resurrected Jesus still serving his people Jesus is serving his disciples.

He is feeding his sheep But we'll wait for Jesus to tell Peter them Now none of the disciples dared ask him who are you?

They knew it was the Lord Jesus came And took the bread and gave it to them and so with the fish This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead In our text it says none of the disciples asked who this was Because they knew it was the Lord Now the text doesn't tell us this but we can assume That Jesus's resurrected body looked different after his trial crucifixion and death But what is John telling us?

We recognize Jesus from his actions Not his appearance We recognize Jesus from his actions not his appearance What was I trying to do?

Why did I read that Luke chapter 5?

Verse why am I bringing up all these things that Jesus had that were either mentioned in John or mentioned throughout the story Scriptures because these little nuggets are The gospel writers They're trying to show this exact point That we can recognize Jesus.

We don't need to have a have a physical representation of a picture of Jesus We can look at his actions And so I mentioned this earlier but as I slowly begin our descent For this morning What do you do when you can't hear the voice of God?

Let's hold this that last thought if we recognize Jesus from his actions not his appearance And apply that as we're asking what do you do when you cannot hear the voice of God?

Where do you turn?

What do you do the text tells us here at the end that the the disciples knew it was Jesus?

Why because he was laying breadcrumbs for them throughout this whole interaction Jesus had just shown up to them like that before and so now here he is doing it again Hey, have you guys caught any fish?

No, why don't you try the other side?

That's gotta be Jesus only Jesus would say that one Jesus or some crazy dad joke We recognize Jesus from his actions So what should we do what should you do when you can't hear the voice voice of God?

I've got four things for us And a couple of these are going to be actually probably all of them are going to be no brainers What do we do when we can't hear the voice of God?

Um, turn to the word of God Are you are you actually reading scripture?

Because scripture is where we find the voice of God most clearly There is no Uh Clearer representation of the voice of God than the than the words of God for us That's why we have these scriptures so that we can understand and see the voice And the actions of God, so are you reading it?

Are you reading the scriptures?

There is no static on the line in the scriptures This is where we hear the voice of God most clearly Second church Get to church revelation chapter one John has a vision And Jesus is in the is is is walking in the midst of these lamp stands and later John will tell us in revelation chapter one that these lamp stands represent his churches and Jesus is in their midst What's the picture that painting that john is painting for us that Jesus is in the midst of his people Jesus is in the midst of his church.

Why because The church is his bride.

Jesus is not a far off a Working out of state husband Jesus is present in and with his bride the church and so And he tells us this in matthew 1820 for where two or three are gathered in my name there I am among them when we gather Jesus is in our midst That's why the writer in hebrus will tell us to not forsake the gathering of churches of of the church Because Jesus is with us Jesus is in our midst What else can we do what else should we do when we can't hear the voice of God?

We need to pray Jesus is he's sharing in Matthew chapter six about prayer.

He says it a few times he says When you pray Well, I gave it up.

There you go.

When you pray Give you the last one there.

It came out of order When you pray That's what Jesus says in Matthew chapter six when you pray And then our next one is the next thing to do is fast If we keep reading in Matthew chapter six after Jesus gives the Lord's prayer again, he says when you fast now Of course, we have to be careful here.

This is not an explicit command from Jesus That we need to be fasting at however much However frequently But just to be safe I went to the greek and I searched and looked up the word win And what's crazy is in the greek the word win It it means win It means a point of time So it is not a command for us to fast, but I I think I think It is Expected and just for clarity because nowadays there's intermittent fasting.

There's juice fasting.

There's the daniel fast There's the social media fast all these fasts which for most of those Let's call them a a detox.

It's a juice detox.

It's a social media detox It's it's a daniel detox But it's not a fast biblical fasting would be With holding of all food minus water you can have water because you kind of need that to live But Biblical fasting would also be for the purpose of seeking the Lord at not for health reasons although those follow which Might be what jesus is referring to when he says your father will reward you for fasting It's like, oh, hey, your body's better your body begins to heal it heal itself when you fast, but that's neither here nor there fasting So what do we do when we came to the voice of god turn to the word of god get to church pray fast If you are having a hard time Hearing the lord the first place I would ask you to look is your calendar You prioritize what you make time for The opposite is also true you make time for what you prioritize And these four things that i've mentioned this morning are not a litmus test This is not like oh great.

I checked three out of four.

So i'm passing kind of thing but The desire the the reason that I had I connected these things is so that we would be like peter And understand shame and all Understand guilt and all understand not feeling good enough and all Not feeling strong enough not feeling like i'm where i need to be enough all these silly things that we put in the way that In the midst of our feelings that our actions Would do the opposite that our actions would be us jumping out of the boat and swimming towards Jesus that our actions would be I know I feel this way I know I've got x y and z going on.

I know these things, but my actions are going to do the exact opposite Than my feelings i'm going to run to god.

I'm going to trust god even though I don't feel like I can hear him Even though I don't feel like I'm setting myself up in such a way In such a way i'm living my life in such a way that regardless of my feelings I'm in the word regardless of my feelings.

I'm coming to church regardless Of the busyness of my life i'm setting time aside to pray by myself to pray with my spouse to pray with my children to pray And Maybe you would even be so Crazy To follow scripture and fast To give up some of the some of the things that we find so easy and so comfortable in our life Because Hearing the voice of jesus obeying jesus being Submitted and abiding in jesus is far more important than a cheeseburger I love me a good cheeseburger But I would rather Be close to jesus Than indulge and enjoy something here on this earth So let us be people Who turn to the word of god who get to church Who Get to a group who get to A prayer gathering who get to Praying with one another praying By ourselves praying With our family that we would be people who fast So that we could run towards him And also understand that knowing that as we run towards jesus that he's ready to serve us He's prepared a meal for us And as we'll see with peter He's also going to confront you to do what jesus has called you to do But more on that next week let's pray together jesus we thank you that you hear us That you see us that you serve us we thank you lord for your Constance in our life father may we be people who are willing to do whatever it takes To be close to you Even in the midst of our shame In the midst of our guilt in the midst of us not feeling like we are enough May we still run to you jesus Spirit would you show us How we can be more devoted to you Again not for our salvation, but because we desire To be with you to abide in you We love you lord we thank you that you serve us we thank you that you Convict us and you challenge us Not just for ourselves But for the people around us In the world Because how else is the world going to hear your gospel message if we do not share it ourselves It's in jesus' name we pray amen amen You
