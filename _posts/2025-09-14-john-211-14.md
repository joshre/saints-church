## Transcription

If we were to kind of look at all the different themes and things that John has been teaching throughout this gospel, especially this coming to a close, right?

I mean, like, if we look at the last few verses of John chapter 20, the purpose of this book, Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book, but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name, right?

That's the last verses in John chapter 20.

And so that would be like a nice end to the letter, to the story that John has played out for us.

Except he hasn't yet tied the bow.

He hasn't yet completed the story of Peter.

And so that's what we see throughout almost all of this whole chapter, is John closing the book, dotting the I's and crossing the T's for Peter.

Oh, Simon Peter.

I guess he's got an I and a T.

Anyways.

Okay, let's jump in.

Verse 1.

After this, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way.

Simon Peter, Thomas, called the twin.

There it is again, twin Thomas.

What did I tell you last week?

Nathaniel, spelled incorrectly, of Cana in Galilee, the son of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.

So, again, we will see this is the third time in John where Jesus reveals himself to the disciples.

So we've got Peter, twin Thomas, Nate Dogg, Zebedee, the sons of Zebedee, which are James and John, and two other disciples.

Whoever they are, they weren't worth naming.

So, sucks to be those guys, I guess.

You were this close to making it into the Bible, but at least you made it to heaven.

Verse 3.

Simon Peter said to them, I'm going fishing.

They said to him, we will go with you.

They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.

Yes.

Simon said to the gang, I'm going fishing.

We've been sitting around here for a while.

I just need something to do.

I don't know if you have a friend who can't just chill on the couch all day and needs to get up and go do something.

I'm not looking at some of you in this room.

But Peter's like, I can't sit here any longer.

I've got to go fishing.

And they all follow, but it was a rough night of fishing.

I feel like I've heard this set up before.

I feel like this is starting to sound familiar.

Verse 4.

Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore, yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.

Jesus said to them, children, do you have any fish?

They answered him, no.

He said to them, cast the net to the right side of the boat and you will find some.

So they cast it and now they were not able to haul it in because the quantity of fish.

So, if we were to take a step back and look at the full context that John 21 gives us, Jesus is about 100 yards off of the shore.

So about a football field in length.

And our text says, children, that Jesus calls out to them, children, do you have any fish?

And that Jesus is probably saying something more along the lines of like, fellows or gentlemen.

Or if you ask me, he's like, my dudes, you got any fish?

And again, I feel like I've heard this before.

I've heard this before in the gospel accounts.

I've heard this kind of set up before.

And they reply, no.

And Jesus tells them to cast their nets to the other side.

Now, again, we've probably all heard this before.

This is all stuff we've heard and seen Jesus do before with the disciples.

And in fact, if we were to turn to Luke chapter 5, and this is early on in Jesus' ministry.

And it tells us in Luke chapter 5, on one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gethsemane.

So again, these are two different stories.

This is not the same place.

Sea of Tiberias, Sea of Gethsemane.

And he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.

Again, these are two different stories.

Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little while from the land.

And he sat down and taught the people from the boat.

And when he had finished speaking, he said to him, Simon, put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.

And Simon answered, Master, Master, we toiled all night and took nothing.

Didn't we just read that?

Obviously different, but you know what I mean.

But at your word, I will let down the nets.

And when he had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish and their nets were breaking.

They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them.

And they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink.

But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees saying, Depart from me for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken.

So this is, again, Luke chapter 5.

This is when Jesus first calls some of these disciples in a very similar scenario, in a very similar situation.

And so the disciples are here, are here with Jesus in John chapter 21.

And all these things, and the text tells us that they catch 153 fish.

Why the exact number?

Who knows?

But it's a lot of fish for these first century nets.

Verse 7 continues and tells us, That disciple whom Jesus loved, John, said to Peter, It is the Lord.

When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work and threw himself into the sea.

So John elbows Peter and is like, Dude, that's Jesus!

Side note.

Have the voices in your head ever been so loud that you could not hear the voice of God?

Simon, or John, elbows Peter.

It's almost like Peter was, I don't know, so in the zone or whatever.

It was taking Peter at least an extra moment that John had to give him one of these to be like, Dude, that's the Lord.

Then John gives us this really interesting note on Peter's actions.

He does the exact opposite of what most of us do when we're about to jump into the water.

Peter puts on his outer cloak.

What do you usually do when you get in, or are going to go into the water?

You take off your clothes.

And here, Peter is doing the opposite.

Why does John give us this detail?

I cannot say for certain, but I believe John is trying to fill us in on some of what Peter is feeling, on some of what Peter is going through.

Now let me take us back to Genesis.

Adam and Eve, they take a bite of the fruit, they feel shame, and they recognize their nakedness.

And what is Peter in this moment doing?

He's probably feeling shameful.

We know later in the text it tells us he's grieved.

And what does he do?

He covers himself.

But, yet Peter, he does not run away from Jesus.

He runs towards Jesus.

Peter feels shameful for his actions.

And as we will see later in the chapter, there is resolution.

But there is not any yet.

So we cannot go there yet.

Because we don't want to sit in this uncomfortability between Peter and Jesus.

We want to jump to, okay, but they're all good.

They're all good.

We like resolution.

We like that.

But we're not there yet, so don't go there yet.

There's not any yet, so don't give that to Peter yet.

He's in his fields, and he covers himself and yet he jumps into the sea and he threw himself towards Jesus.

I just want to take a moment and say in the midst of this week, in the midst of all of the devastation and the terror that has happened all over our country this week and the last couple weeks, what do we need to do as a country?

What do we need to do as a people and as the church?

Shame and all.

We need to run towards Jesus.

We need to jump out of the boat and start swimming towards the sea where Jesus is.

What is the remedy for pain?

What is the remedy for death?

What is the remedy for brokenness?

It's Jesus.

He's the only one who saves and he's the only one who can fix this brokenness in our world, who can fix the pain, who can fix death.

Jesus is the only one.

And so as people in the midst of our shame, in the midst of whatever you're going through here now in this moment, we need to run, we need to jump in the water towards Jesus.

Jesus.

He's the only one that can fix anything.

We are helpless without him.

The other disciples, verse 8, came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.

So while Peter is swimming to shore, the rest of the boys, they're wrestling this 153 group of fish.

When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place with fish laid out on it and bread.

And Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish that you just caught.

So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, 153 of them.

And although there were so many, the net was not torn.

Jesus said to them, Come and have breakfast.

Verse 9, When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place.

Does this sound familiar?

Is this ringing a bell?

John chapter 18, Peter denies Jesus during his trial around a charcoal fire.

And yet here, John mentions again a charcoal fire.

John is just dropping all kinds of Easter eggs all over.

But let's not get caught up in those things.

Let's remind ourselves of Jesus' actions.

What is Jesus doing here?

He is feeding his sheep.

He is feeding and serving his disciples.

Here is the resurrected Jesus still serving his people.

Jesus is serving his disciples.

He is feeding his sheep.

But we'll wait for Jesus to tell Peter that.

Now none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you?

They knew it was the Lord.

Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and so with the fish.

This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.

In our text, it says, none of the disciples asked who this was because they knew it was the Lord.

Now, the text doesn't tell us this, but we can assume that Jesus' resurrected body looked different after his trial, crucifixion, and death.

But, what is John telling us? we recognize Jesus from his actions, not his appearance.

We recognize Jesus from his actions, not his appearance.

What was I trying to do?

Why did I read that Luke chapter 5 verse?

Why am I bringing up all these things that Jesus had that were either mentioned in John or mentioned throughout the scriptures?

Because these little nuggets are the gospel writers they're trying to show this exact point that we can recognize Jesus we don't need to have a physical representation of a picture of Jesus we can look at his actions.

And so I mentioned this earlier but as I slowly begin our descent for this morning what do you do when you can't hear the voice of God? let's hold that last thought if we recognize Jesus from his actions not his appearance and apply that as we're asking what do you do when you cannot hear the voice of God?

Where do you turn?

What do you do?

The text tells us here at the end that the disciples knew it was Jesus why?

Because he was laying breadcrumbs for them throughout this whole interaction Jesus had just shown up to them like that before and so now here he is doing it again hey have you guys caught any fish?

No why don't you try the other side?

That's gotta be Jesus only Jesus would say that line Jesus or some crazy dad joke we recognize Jesus from his actions so what should we do what should you do when you can't hear the voice of God I've got four things for us and a couple of these are going to be actually probably all of them are going to be no brainers what do we do when we can't hear the voice of God turn to the word of God are you are you actually reading scripture because scripture is where we find the voice of God most clearly there is no clearer representation of the voice of God than the words of God for us that's why we have these scriptures so that we can understand and see the voice and the actions of God so are you reading it are you reading the scriptures there is no static on the line in the scriptures this is where we hear the voice of God most clearly second church get to church revelation chapter one John has a vision and Jesus is walking in the midst of these lampstands and later John will tell us in revelation chapter one that these lampstands represent his churches and Jesus is in their midst what's the picture that painting that John is painting for us that Jesus is in the midst of his people Jesus is in the midst of his church why because the church is his bride Jesus is not a far off a working out of state husband Jesus is present in and with his bride the church and so and he tells us this in Matthew 18 20 for where two or three are gathered in my name there I am among them when we gather Jesus is in our midst that's why the writer in Hebrews will tell us to not forsake the gathering of churches of the church because Jesus is with us Jesus is in our midst what else can we do what else should we do when we can't hear the voice of God we need to pray Jesus is he's sharing in Matthew chapter 6 about prayer he says it a few times he says when you pray I gave it up there you go when you pray give you the last one there it came out of order when you pray that's what Jesus says in Matthew chapter 6 when you pray and then our next one is the next thing to do is fast if we keep reading in Matthew chapter 6 after Jesus gives the Lord's prayer again he says when you fast now of course we have to be careful here this is not an explicit command from Jesus that we need to be fasting at however much however frequently but just to be safe I went to the Greek and I searched and looked up the word win and what's crazy is in the Greek the word win it it means win it means a point of time so it is not a command for us to fast but I I think it is expected and just for clarity because nowadays there's intermittent fasting there's juice fasting there's the Daniel fast there's a social media fast all these fasts which for most of those let's call them a detox it's a juice detox it's a social media detox it's it's a Daniel detox but it's not a fast biblical fasting would be withholding of all food minus water you can have water because you kind of need that to live but biblical fasting would also be for the purpose of seeking the Lord not for health reasons although those follow which might be what Jesus is referring to when he says your father will reward you for fasting it's like oh hey your body's better your body begins to heal itself when you fast but that's neither here nor there fasting so what do we do when we came to the voice of God turn to the word of God get to church pray fast if you are having a hard time hearing the Lord the first place I would ask you to look is your calendar you prioritize what you make time for the opposite is also true you make time for what you prioritize and these four things that I've mentioned this morning are not a litmus test this is not like oh great I checked three out of four so I'm passing kind of thing but the desire the reason that I connected these things is so that we would be like Peter and understand shame and all understand guilt and all understand not feeling good enough and all not feeling strong enough not feeling like I'm where I need to be enough all these silly things that we put in the way that in the midst of our feelings that our actions would do the opposite that our actions would be us jumping out of the boat and swimming towards Jesus that our actions would be I know I feel this way I know I've got X Y and Z going on I know these things but my actions are going to do the exact opposite than my feelings I'm going to run to God I'm going to trust God even though I don't feel like I can hear him even though I don't feel like I'm setting myself up in such a way I'm living my life in such a way that regardless of my feelings I'm in the word regardless of my feelings I'm coming to church regardless of the busyness of my life I'm setting time aside to pray by myself to pray with my spouse to pray with my children to pray and maybe you would even be so crazy to follow scripture and fast to give up some of the things that we find so easy and so comfortable in our life because hearing the voice of Jesus obeying Jesus being submitted and abiding in Jesus is far more important than a cheeseburger I love me a good cheeseburger but I would rather be close to Jesus than indulge and enjoy something here on this earth so let us be people who turn to the word of God who get to church who who get to a group who get to a prayer gathering who get to praying with one another praying by ourselves praying with our family that we would be people who fast so that we could run towards him and also understand that knowing that as we run towards Jesus that he's ready to serve us he's prepared a meal for us and as we'll see with Peter he's also going to confront you to do what Jesus has called you to do but more on that next week let's pray together Jesus we thank you that you hear us that you see us that you serve us we thank you Lord for your constants in our life father may we be people who are willing to do whatever it takes to be close to you even in the midst of our shame in the midst of our guilt in the midst of us not feeling like we are enough may we still run to you Jesus spirit would you show us how we can be more devoted to you again not for our salvation but because we desire to be with you to abide in you we love you Lord we thank you that you serve us we thank you that you convict us and you challenge us not just for ourselves but for the people around us and the world because how else is the world going to hear your gospel message if we do not share it ourselves in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen amen amen
