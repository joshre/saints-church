<p>In this sermon we cover all of Acts chapter 15. We take a deep dive into the Jerusalem council some of the takeaways for the early Church and for us today in the Church.</p>

## Transcription

Awesome.

We're going to jump into Acts chapter 15 this morning, and I'm going to try my best to get us out of here on time.

We're going to cover a lot of ground and a lot of good things this morning.

So let's go.

All right, last week, Acts chapter 14.

Let me catch you up.

Paul and Barnabas, they're traveling throughout the region of Galatia, preaching and proclaiming the gospel.

And they're helping plant and set up churches with the plurality of elders.

And along the way, some people think Paul and Barnabas are Greek gods.

And so they start worshiping them and sacrificing to idols and different things like that.

And they reject that.

And then because of that, then Paul is stoned, not like Snoop Dogg stoned, but like rocks thrown at him stoned.

And sorry, I've been watching a lot of the Olympics and Snoop Dogg somehow is like all over the Olympics, which is quite entertaining and also random.

Whatever.

So they throw rocks at him.

He gets stoned.

The people think he's dead and he's not.

And then they continue to spread the gospel.

And now I want to read to you the last few.

Verses of Acts chapter 14, accompanied with a handy dandy map.

And so we can remember where we came from, or I guess where they were coming from and where they were going.

And then the setting at which our current chapter begins.

OK, so Acts 14 here.

Let's read this together.

And they came and passed through Poseidon, which is just right here.

I meant to have I meant to have the little.

There we go.

That do it.

Poseidon right there.

They came through Poseidon and then came to Pamphylia, which is this region right here.

And when they had the and when they had spoken the word in Perga, there we are.

They went down to Atalia, Italia, whatever.

And from there they sailed to Antioch.

So they got on their sailboat and right over here to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled.

So they started their journey.

They started their missionary journey in Antioch.

And then now they're finally back in Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had fulfilled.

And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.

And they remained no little time with the disciples.

So Paul and Barnabas are back from their travels.

The first missionary trip, if you're keeping track, is done.

Complete.

Check.

So and then they gather everyone together.

They're sharing all the things that God done in the whole trip.

And it's all good things.

It's amazing.

Yeah.

And then this happened.

And then and then Paul was stoned.

It was crazy.

And look, he's still alive.

Praise God.

And then they're finally end that part.

And then Paul and Barnabas are like, what about you guys?

We've been talking the whole time.

Like, tell us about what's happening here, which turns us to Acts chapter 15.

Let's just work at verse one through three here.

I'll just read the first verse, though.

Acts 15 one.

But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers.

Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.

Oh, boy.

It's about to go down in Acts chapter 15.

And we're not going to address this issue fully in its entirety now, because as we'll see, this is one of the key themes in Acts chapter 15.

And so.

We'll let the apostles do their thing and then we'll break it down further.

Let's continue.

Verse two.

And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question.

So Paul and Barnabas are arguing with the with the church and the these Jewish leaders in Antioch who were saying that the Gentiles needed to be circumcised.

And so there's there they're clashing.

There's debate back and forth.

And then they're like, let's go to Jerusalem.

Let's go to home base and let's discuss this matter further.

So verse three.

So being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles and brought great joy to all the brothers.

So their journey here, as we'll see, it would have taken about two to three weeks.

It's quite some.

It's quite a trek.

It's about 250.

It's about 300 miles.

And so they would have stopped in a bunch of cities along the way and would have been, you know, sharing of all the works and all the things that how the gospel was advancing and a bunch of good things.

And so then we get to verse four.

When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them.

But some believers who belong to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses.

The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.

So they arrive in Jerusalem and they're initially welcomed by the church.

And then they're like sharing stories.

And yeah, and then God did this.

And it's been amazing.

And then one of them goes, wait, wait, wait, wait.

But did you circumcise them?

And they're like, no.

And so now we have the apostles, which would have been the 12 sent by Jesus.

Of course, now, because of in Acts 12, one of them, James, the brother of John, he's executed.

So the 12 would now be now 11.

And then we have the apostles.

We have the elders of the of the Christian church in Jerusalem all here.

And then whatever delegation was there from this church in Antioch represented by Paul and Barnabas and the people that they brought with them along for the journey.

So this is all the people.

All the leaders who are part of this Jerusalem council.

OK, now, verse seven.

And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.

And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us.

And he made no distinction between us and them.

Having cleansed their hearts by faith.

Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?

But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.

So the text tells us that there's much debate, right?

This is the second time we're having a debate now about this whole idea of Gentiles needing to become Jews and follow the law.

And circumcised and all those awesome things, if you will.

And then Peter, he speaks up.

And I would kind of consider this the beginning of the closing arguments, if you will.

And Peter first says that God chose him to be the apostle to take the gospel message to the Gentiles.

So if we go back to Acts chapter 10, Peter is hanging out.

He's waiting for his lunch.

And he has a vision from God of these animals on a sheet, on a blanket or a sheet that covers the earth.

And then it's all these unclean animals, according to the law.

And Peter is like, what's going on?

And then he hears a voice say, eat.

Like, you can eat them.

Essentially, what I, and then the voice says, what I have made clean, you shall not call unclean.

And then after that, Cornelius, this Roman guy, this Gentile who was a God-fearer, he sends for Peter.

He's given a vision and said, send for Peter.

And so he sends for Peter.

And Peter, they go and get Peter.

And then they, he goes over to Cornelius' house.

And then Peter shares the gospel with Cornelius and his family.

And he's saved.

They're baptized.

And then the sign that happens is they begin to speak in tongues.

And what's important is that it was the same sign that Peter and the other, well, now Christians, would have gotten in Acts chapter 2, the day of Pentecost.

And so what Peter is saying, he's going like, hey, I was there, Acts 2, Pentecost.

I was there for that.

I was there for Cornelius and that whole thing.

And so I'm kind of an expert on this subject matter.

And what does?

Peter said, he says, God bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, right?

God bore witness to them by giving them, bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit that I just crossed out.

So who does the saving, right?

Man?

Does a specific, are we saved by a specific prayer?

Is there a specific church denomination?

No, God bore witness to them by giving them the same spirit.

The same spirit that the believing Jews had at Pentecost and beyond was given to the Gentiles.

God made no distinction between us being Jew and them being Gentile, having cleansed their hearts by faith.

The Gentiles who have come to faith in Jesus have received the Holy Spirit and thus experienced the purifying transformation of the heart.

The heart means that the distinction between ritually pure Jews and morally impure and ungodly Gentiles have been abolished.

There is this, there's no longer this separation.

There is no distinction.

No distinction.

No distinction between the holy people of Israel and the unholy Gentiles who are saved by faith in Jesus Christ.

Okay, now we get to verse 10.

Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test?

God to the test.

In the Old Testament, testing God often meant the Israelites wanted to discover whether God noticed sin and whether he would really punish it.

I think if you're a parent or if you've seen a child who's like, how close can I get to disobeying without disobeying?

This is the test.

The testing idea.

How close can I get to the outlet before touching it, before trying to put my finger in it, before mom or dad goes and smacks it?

How close can I get?

And the point there is they were trying to discover whether God noticed the sin and if he would punish it.

So testing God usually came as the result of unbelief and mistrust by God's people.

So what Peter is essentially saying here is that these Judaizers, have a lack of trust in God, either through Peter's revelation or unbelief in the sign of the Holy Spirit that has been shown in the Gentiles.

Then he continues putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciple.

A yoke links two animals together, enabling them to do the will of the Father.

That's armor, right?

Like there might be two oxen here.

Oh no, what just happened?

What did I do?

We back.

Okay.

So a yoke would be like, you've got two sort of things here.

I'm not a great artist, guys, so don't hold your breath.

And then there would be some sort of wooden piece that would connect it either top and bottom or just top.

And then you have your, you have your oxen here.

And usually how this is used in the Old Testament, it would yoke the law of God, so God's law, along with God's people.

So you have, these are the two sides of the yoke, right?

Like in the New Testament, we get this picture of a man and woman being unequally yoked.

What happens here is that when you have two oxen who are of the same shape, the strength that are plowing the field together, it keeps them even.

But what happens if one of these oxen be, be slowed down or get hurt?

It ends up hurting the weaker one.

And so in this instance of the law and the people, the law of God and the people of God, the Israelites, if they follow the law of God, then it leads to life and flourishing and communion with God.

But if there's, if the people disobey the law, then there's this, this tension, there's this, there's this struggle, there's death is the result of this.

But usually when we see it, when we see this used, it's always positive.

But what we see here is Peter saying on the neck of the disciples, that would lead to some sort of negative connotation, right?

Like it's, if it's on your neck, it's, it's strangling you.

It's hurting you.

The, yoke is hurting you.

So we've got this idea of the law of God and the people of God linked together in covenant.

And here it's in a negative connotation that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear.

And this is something here that we often overlook as New Testament Christians.

Whenever we think of the law, it usually has like negative connotation, right?

Some sort of negative feelings, the law, bad, the gospel, good.

But the New Testament never calls the law bad.

In fact, Jesus says he came to, he came to fulfill the law, not abolish it.

And then Paul in Romans seven says that the law is holy and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.

And so just as we see this picture of, of a yoke here, the law kept the Israelites in right standing with God.

The mosaic law included these burnt offerings, sin offerings, guilt offerings, and other rituals.

And God gave them, these laws, but he also gave them a way to make atonement or make payment for the sins that they would eventually commit so that the people of Israel could stay in, in the yoke or stay in line or in step with God so that the people of God could maintain the holiness of God, of God's people.

The law was good and it is still good now.

But Peter's point here is that our salvation is not fulfilled in the law.

Salvation is given to us by God on account of Jesus Christ and not achieved by one's obedience to the law.

When we put our faith in the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ, his works and righteousness are given to us as our own.

So we no longer need to live under the yoke of the mosaic law.

We no longer need to, uh, to give offerings and sacrifices to main our right standing.

For us, Jesus Christ has fulfilled and accomplished these things for us and has given us the gift of salvation and communion with God.

And so Peter says in verse 11, but we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they, the Gentiles will.

Okay.

Verse 12 and they, and all the assembly fell silent.

And they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.

So all the people in the family assembly fell silent.

In other words, uh, Peter's comments ended the debate.

It was the end of the debate.

Then Barnabas and Paul share some testimonies of how God was working through the Gentiles.

But then we get one more person who speaks up.

Verse 13, let's read.

And after they finished speaking, James replied, brothers, listen to me.

Simon has related how God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people for his name.

And with this, the words of the prophets agree just as it is written.

And after this I will return and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen.

I will rebuild its ruins and I will restore it that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord who make these things, who makes these things known from old.

The text tells us James speaks up himself and it is believed that this James would be the half brother of Jesus and he was believed to have led the Jerusalem church.

So remember we have the Apostles there we have Paul and Barnabas and representing the church in Antioch and then we have the Jerusalem church.

And so we had Peter speak up we had Paul and Barnabas share some stories and now we have a leader of the Jerusalem church speak up.

So now we've had all three delegations represented and spoken and accounted for and he says here that Simon Peter described how God first intervened or visited the Gentiles and so he's describing in other words what Peter just talked about the conversion of Cornelius and his family but there's something that we cannot miss here.

And it is in verse 14 the phrase a people for his name a people for his name when Luke the writer of Acts uses the word people he is almost always using it in reference to the Jews the chosen people of God and now he is using it to describe converted Gentiles what could this mean God first visited let's read this again God first visited the Jews to take.

To take from them a people for his name that word take there could also be translated as acquired so in other words these Gentiles are acquired by God as his people just as Israel had been chosen by God as his people Exodus 19 5 Moses on Mount Sinai and God tells Moses to tell the people now therefore if you indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant you shall be my treasured possession.

Among all the peoples.

Exodus 19 5 these people the Israelites are God's treasured possession among the people they were chosen by God acquired by God another meaning of this phrase a people for his name could I mean we could just look at the words of Jesus John 10 16 and I have other sheep that are not of this fold I must bring them also and they are not of this fold.

And they will listen to my voice so there will be one flock one shepherd what is Jesus showing us here that the term people of God can no longer be reserved just for Israel in terms of ethnicity or ritual practice that the people of God are all people who have faith in Jesus as Israel's crucified risen and exalted Messiah and Savior there is one flock.

All Jesus believers and one shepherd Jesus Christ himself and then James himself lays out some Old Testament meaning for the people of God including Gentiles through his quote of Amos chapter 9 this is the last chapter of Amos's prophecy and in Amos God has sent judgment upon Israel but there would be a restoration in the future a restoration particularly of the tent of David which is most likely in reference to the house of God.

Or dynasty of David so coming from the family line of David which had ended with come to an end with Jehoiakim and Zedekiah and they were forced into exile in Babylon you can see second Kings chapter 24 for more if you'd like and at the at that time the nations have been invaded and conquered and will be called by God's name okay we're going to look at these verses more deeply put on your thinking caps here people.

Verse 16 after this I will return and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen I will rebuild its ruins and I will restore it that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord and all the Gentiles who are called by my name says the Lord who makes these things known from old if you were to turn in your Bibles to Amos chapter 9 you would actually see a few different words and some additions here that James himself makes and we're not going to get into that.

Verse 19 therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols and from sexual immorality and from what has been strangled and from blood for from ancient generations Moses has had in every Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.

Okay so we just talked about how the law is good and now James is saying that the law is trouble how do we resolve that the trouble he is referring to is most likely the demands that the Pharisee Christians are putting on these Gentile believers for circumcision and just wholesale submission to the Mosaic law as preconditions for salvation preconditions for salvation.

And acceptance into the people of God the trouble does not lie in the law the trouble is that what these Jewish Christians were wanting was an allegiance to Jewish law and life to become the people of God when that is not necessary for salvation.

Okay let's carry on verse 22 then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas they sent Judas called Barsabbas and Silas leading men along the way.

Along among the brothers with the following letter so here's the letter that they that these people brought to the church the brothers both the apostles and the elders to the brothers who are of the Gentiles and Antioch and Syria and Sicilia greetings since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words and settling your minds although we gave them no instruction it has seemed good to us having come to one accord to choose men and send them to you with.

Our beloved Barnabas and Paul men who have risked their lives for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we have therefore sent Judas and Silas who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth for it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what has been strangled from sexual immorality if you keep yourselves from these you will do.

Well farewell okay so we get the contents of the letter right that's the letter that they sent and they're like hey you're saved by grace through faith in Jesus amen just do these things verse 29 that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what has been strangled from sexual immorality if you keep yourselves from these things you will do well why these four things why these four things.

Let's look at him kind of piece by piece abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols in the Greco Roman world meat was commonly sacrificed in pagan temples then it was sold in markets and then it was served and this temple worship and social life were very much so intertwined and so eating idol meat often implied participation in idolatry this meat was sacrificed at whoever's temple.

And then you went and you're like hey can I get a couple of New York strips and they're like yeah here you go and then you take those back to your house and you eat and by way of this now you are eating this idol meat so for the Jews this would break one of the Ten Commandments you shall have no other gods before me do not worship engraving images and just yeah a lot of the Ten Commandments the first three actually but for the Gentile if eating temple idol meat and.

Your life are intertwined there needs to be a distinction that the old is gone this meat sacrifice to idols is part of your former life you are different now you need to eat differently you need to live differently and Paul will later clarify in first Corinthians chapters eight through ten if I were to boil it down essentially that the meat itself is not morally defiled but it's the participation.

In idol worship that is wrong that's what's not good and so for these Gentile converts this is a purging of pagan worship and pagan life to worship the one true God that's why this meat or abstain what has been sacrificed to idols is important and then we get from blood and from what has been strangled and these two go together Israel was told in Leviticus 17 verse 11 the life of the flesh is in the flesh.

In the blood so these are dietary regulations centered on a reverence for life right from a Jewish perspective we honor life we respect blood so we don't consume it and if an animal is strangled then it still has blood in it it was not properly cared for why would this matter to these Gentile believers twofold first table fellowship.
