## Transcription

Our prayer gathering this upcoming Wednesday, February 4th, 7 p.m.

It's the first Wednesday of the month, which means we are gathering for prayer and worship.

I'm looking forward to it.

It's going to be a good one.

Don't miss it.

Put it in your calendar.

But this morning, we are in Acts chapter 13.

We are looking at the whole chapter.

We've been going kind of chapter by chapter.

Through the book of Acts.

Usually we teach verse by verse, but this series, or this book, we're going chapter by chapter.

Speed up the pace a little bit.

You know what I'm saying?

We're almost at the halfway mark.

But let me catch you up.

As we transition, chapter 12 is a lot of persecution.

Peter's in prison, and then an angel lets him out of prison, and it's kind of...

Chapter 12 is honestly kind of chaotic, and then we move into chapter 13, which we'll see here is the continued advancement of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

The message is continuing to advance, which is a powerful truth for us to think of and be reminded of this morning, that nothing can stop the movement of the gospel.

This message that has been passed down to us and given to us, that nothing can stop it.

Of course, we know that because here we are, 2,000 plus years later, still talking about this man and this message.

Nothing can stop the advancement of Jesus Christ.

All right, Acts 13, here we go.

Verse 1, imagine that.

Now, there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon, who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Mannion, a lifelong friend of Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul.

While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.

Then, after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them and sent them off.

So, we get this list of guys and prophets and teachers and prophets in the sense probably would have functioned very similarly to the Old Testament prophets, which operated under God's revelation.

And they expressed that to the people of God in terms of exhortation and instruction and critique, as well as encouragement and also at times predictions about future events.

And teachers would have been teachers of the Word of God, which is pretty kind of self-explanatory.

Which, of course, was mainly the Old Testament.

But also, as we've seen in all of the sermons so far in Acts, and the sermon that Paul will later give in Acts chapter 13, we see they are using and teaching Old Testament scriptures in light of Jesus Christ.

Which is a good thing to do.

So, these roles would have been leaders in the church, prophets, teachers, as well as one of the other words that Luke uses while writing the book of Acts is this term elders when he talks about church leadership roles.

But the question I have is, what about today?

Do we still see prophets?

Of course, there's teachers.

I'm trying my best to do that right now.

There's teachers of the Word all over the place.

Praise God.

But do we still see prophets?

I would argue that in alignment with our confession, the Second London Baptist Confession of 1689, that the prophets in Acts and the epistles are understood as sort of foundational servants of the revelation whose office ceased with the completion of scripture.

So, do we have modern-day prophets who act like Old Testament prophets, the Old Testament prophets that we see, or even these prophets that Luke is mentioning here?

I would say no.

I would affirm that Christ now governs his church through the ordinary ministry of the Word by pastors and teachers.

You build a foundation once, and now we live in alignment with the scriptures.

The point here is, what do we fall back on?

As you're being discipled by Instagram and TikTok and YouTube shorts, as we're watching videos and a Christian one comes up, are we just taking all those words at face value, or are we taking the words that have been spoken to us, given to us, and responding to them and receiving them in light of scripture?

That's what I want to say about that.

Okay, next I want to read the first six verses again, but I want it to be accompanied by a map.

Yeah, you guys can see that.

Can you see that all right?

Great.

I want it to be accompanied by a map because we see a lot of different spaces and places here, and I want us to get somewhat acquainted with these spaces and places.

So let me read the first six verses for us, and let's see.

Is this going to point it out?

Oh, yeah.

Check that out.

I'm not leaving Mark.

Cool.

Now, they were in the church at Antioch.

Boom, right here.

Also says starting point.

That's helpful.

Prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon, who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Mannion, a lifelong friend of Herod, the Tetrarch, and Saul, while they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.

Then after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them and sent them off.

So being sent out, verse 4, so being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia.

Hello.

Seleucia.

And from there, they sailed to Cyprus, this big island right here in the middle, Cyprus.

And when they arrived at Salamaeus, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they had John to assist them.

When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, so they went along here to the whole island as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus.

Okay, we'll pause right there.

So they set sail to this island, which is about 60 miles off the coast, and minister throughout the whole island.

And this island was mainly a copper mine, which I've never worked a copper mine before, but I could imagine that's hard work.

I spared myself the YouTube search because that was a rabbit hole that I did not want to go down.

Self-control happens every once in a while for me.

At any rate, there was a Jewish community and presence there on this island, and so they went to the synagogues and preached there.

And so they made it to the other side of the island, which is about 120 miles, and they come upon this magician false prophet named Bar-Jesus.

And, you know, the descriptions that it tells us that he's a false, a magician false prophet named Bar-Jesus, the question we have to ask is, did they come to this knowledge ahead of time?

Did they hear of this man beforehand?

Or after this interaction that they're about to have with him, they're like, yeah, this dude's crazy.

At any rate, let's read.

Verse 7.

So just real quick, Bar-Jesus, Elmaeus, that's the same guy.

For that is the meaning of his name.

Opposed them, seeking to turn the procouncil away from the faith.

But Paul, sorry, Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him, and said, You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?

And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.

Immediately, mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand.

Then the procouncil believed, and when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.

So, what happens here is Bar-Jesus, or Elmaeus, which again, that's the same guy, was working with Sergius Paulus, who was a Roman senator.

And he was over this region here.

And he called for Saul and Barnabas to hear what these guys had to say, and Elmaeus, Bar-Jesus, did not like what he had to say.

And so, Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, calls this guy out.

Right?

And, the question I was asking was like, why would Bar-Jesus call this guy out?

Why?

Why?

Well, if we know he's a magician, we know he's a false prophet, then, you have to think here, if Paul and Barnabas are coming, and they're sharing this good news of Jesus and the gospel, what message was Bar-Jesus sharing with this Roman senator?

If these people are coming and declaring the truth, then Bar-Jesus would be in protection mode.

He would be like, oh no, my whole life, my whole teaching, my whole, my whole work is destroyed.

Like, he could very quickly become unemployed.

So, he's in protection mode.

And so, he's, you know, it doesn't give us the interactions, or, but he's, every time that they say something, he's saying the opposite, it almost seems like.

And so, Paul calls this guy out, and what happens?

He becomes blinded, and what is the result of this?

The pro-council believes in Jesus, and this gospel message that Paul brought.

Which leads us to ask ourselves, which leads me to ask myself, myself, what are my motives?

What are your motives?

Like, especially as a pastor.

What are my motives as a pastor?

Am I trying to build my ministry?

Am I trying to grow my platform?

Am I trying to get TikTok famous, whatever?

Is that what I really want to do?

Am I more worried about what I do, or do I really want to see the message and gospel of Jesus Christ move forward?

Do I really want to see the message and the gospel of Jesus Christ move in us, and then move in the people that are closest to us, and those within our community, and our world?

Okay, let's continue, but let's go back to the map.

Verse 13.

So Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Persia in Pamphylia.

So here we are, Persia, Pamphylia.

Hello.

And John, that's John Mark, who we were introduced to a couple chapters ago.

John Mark, he returned to Jerusalem.

So we've got this little dashed line here going all the way back to Jerusalem.

Right there.

Jerusalem, verse 14.

But they went on from Persia and came to Antioch in Poseidah.

Okay, so all the way up here, there's another Antioch in Poseidah.

The region right there.

Antioch in Poseidah.

And on the Sabbath day, they went into the synagogue and sat down.

After reading from the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them saying, Brothers, if you have any words of encouragement for the people, say it.

So after these travels, Paul and Barnabas, the week that they get there, whatever, they're probably hanging out.

They're probably going to the synagogues, introducing themselves.

And Paul probably told them about how he was a rabbi himself, a member of the Sanhedrin, or Pharisee rather.

And that he was trained, well-trained.

And so there's probably some connection there that he's having with the rabbis and the synagogue leaders.

And the text tells us that Paul and Barnabas were just part of this service at the synagogue.

And then the leaders send them a message and say, Hey, if you've got anything to say, if you want to encourage the people, go for it.

We'd love to hear it.

And so then Paul goes, say less.

Verse 16.

So Paul stood up and motioning with his hand said, Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen, the God of this people, Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt.

And with uplifted arm, he led them out of it.

And for about 40 years, he put up with them in the wilderness.

And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance.

All this took place about 450 years.

And after that, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.

Then they asked for a king and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for 40 years.

And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be the king of whom he testified and said, I have found in David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.

Of this man's offspring, God has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus, as he promised.

Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

And as John was finishing his course, he said, what do you suppose that I am?

I am not he.

No, but behold, after me, one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.

I want us to notice here the emphasis of Paul's preaching.

Let's jump back to verse 17.

The God of this people, Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt.

And with uplifted arm, he led them out of it.

And for about 40 years, he put up with them in the wilderness.

Who's the emphasis?

Who is the focus?

It is God.

God is the emphasis.

God is the one who's doing all the things.

He's making all the right moves and putting up with the Israelites in the wilderness.

Right?

If we were to turn back and look at the story of the Israelites in the wilderness, they were always grumbling.

They were always complaining.

There was always something going wrong for them.

And what does it say here in verse 18?

He put up with them in the wilderness.

God put up with them.

It was God.

How many times do we come into a Sunday morning thinking, what am I going to get out of this?

What about me?

Where's me in this?

I get it.

I understand it.

I want the preaching to be applicable in your life.

But also we must understand that God is at work.

God is at work in your life.

God is doing all the right things, making all the right moves, and putting up with your grumbling and disobedience, just like the Israelites.

And so may this be a reminder for us to get over ourselves because God is at work.

Maybe for some of us, we needed to hear the rebuke that Paul gave to Bar Jesus.

Why do you make crooked the straight paths of the Lord?

We're the ones sinning.

We have the selfish tendency.

We're the ones that are filled with anger and rage and bitterness.

We're the ones who are looking out for ourselves.

We're the ones who are broken.

And God put up with them in the wilderness, and thank God that He puts up with us.

Let's continue on.

Verse 26.

Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation.

For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize Him, nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning Him.

And though they found in Him no guilt, worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have Him executed.

And when they had carried out all that was written of Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.

But God raised Him from the dead.

And for many days He appeared to those who had come up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His witnesses to the people.

And when we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, this He has fulfilled to us, their children, by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second psalm.

You are my Son.

Today I have begotten you.

And as for the fact that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He has spoken in this way, I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.

Therefore, He says in another psalm, you will not let your Holy One see corruption.

For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption.

But he whom God raised up did not see corruption.

Let it be known to you, therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything, which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.

Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the prophets should come about.

Look, you scoffers, be astounded and perished, for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.

So Paul is now speaking directly about the person and the work of Jesus Christ.

And what's the important conclusion that he makes of Jesus Christ?

Verse 38, Let it be known to you, therefore, brothers and sisters, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.

Through Jesus Christ is the forgiveness of sins.

No longer did their sins need to be atoned for at the temple.

God's pardon for sins is now offered through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, who is Israel's Savior.

But also, verse 39, I want us to look at here.

And by him everyone who believes is freed from everything, from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.

This is really interesting, at least to me here, because when we look at the book of Galatians, which, of course, Paul will write later on, we actually need to remember right now, Paul is in the region of Galatia.

Let me, let me, oh, I don't want that.

Let me show you on the map.

On the map, on the map, on the map, on the map.

Oops.

On the map.

Sorry, I can't help myself.

Right?

So he's in Antioch and Poseidon, and it's this yellow region here in Galatia.

And very early on in Paul's writing to the Galatians, he says, How quickly you forgot the message in which I spoke to you.

And right now, we're reading one of the messages that Paul spoke to him.

And by him everyone who believes is freed from everything, from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.

Paul will go on and talk about, in Galatians, he'll talk about how the law is a teacher.

And here in verse 39, Paul is saying that you are freed from the law of Moses.

And it's not by their works, but by Jesus' works.

Right?

Verse 38, Let it be known to you, therefore, brothers, that through this man, Jesus, forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.

And by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.

In other words, the forgiveness that God provides through Jesus is total forgiveness.

Complete forgiveness.

From everything.

Without exception.

Whatever separates sinners from a righteous and holy God has been forgiven by the person and work of Jesus Christ.

And so, the way we live, the way we act, the way we think about the works that we do, are we looking at those?

Are we thinking that those good works actually get us in better standing with God?

If so, we've got it messed up.

We need to think again.

Because Paul tells us right here that forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to us not by what we have done, but by what Jesus has done.

And how quickly do we forget that?

And so, how do the people respond to this message?

What do they, how do they respond?

Tells us, as they went out, verse 42, as they went out, the people begged that these things might be told to them next Sabbath.

And after the meeting of the synagogue, broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.

They wanted more because the message that they received was not what they were used to.

They were used to, hey, I need to accomplish all these things to get to God.

I need to do all these things to get to God.

And what did Paul just tell them?

Look at what God has done to get to you.

Verse 44, The next Sabbath, almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.

But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him.

And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you, since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life.

Behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.

For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.

Okay, so a week goes by and the next Sabbath day, attendance is booming.

The parking lot is filled to the gills.

Everyone was trying to get to hear this message that Paul and Barnabas were going to speak and bring, and that did not make the synagogue leaders too happy.

And so, Paul and Barnabas, they just call out these synagogue leaders directly and say like, Hey, we did not come up with this plan on our own.

We did not, this wasn't our idea.

This plan and process to, like, this was not, we just came here with the message.

And actually, if you knew your, your scriptures, you would know that actually we were supposed, the message we, we are to bring is supposed to go to the Gentiles.

Paul is quoting Isaiah here.

I have made you a light for the Gentiles that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.

And earlier, Paul quoted Habakkuk warning them that there is a work that they will not believe.

And now he shows how God had a plan for the Gentiles all along.

Verse 48, And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.

And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region.

But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their district.

But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium. and the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

The Gentiles rejoiced and the Jews kicked them out.

But Paul and Barnabas kept focus on the mission and gospel of Jesus Christ.

As we close here in chapter 13, I want to take a step back again and look even at the bigger picture and really kind of compare and contrast chapter 12 and chapter 13.

Right?

Chapter Acts 12 was persecution and killing and imprisoning Christians.

And then what does Luke follow that chapter with?

The advancement of the gospel.

The gospel going to new places and spaces.

Were there challenges and hardships?

For sure.

Right?

We saw some sketchy false prophet who called himself a magician. and then some even crazy situations here with the Jews that we just read in this city, this other city in Antioch.

But the Christians stayed focused and kept preaching the gospel.

And so, are you living your life with such purpose and focus that the gospel truly takes center stage?

Another way to say it might be, does Jesus come up in everyday conversation?

Are you recalling the words and actions of Jesus or even the scriptures in general?

In your marriage, are you proclaiming the gospel?

In your family, where is the gospel?

At your workplace, where is the gospel?

Does Jesus come up in everyday conversation with your spouse, with your family, with your children, with your siblings and co-workers?

Does Jesus come up in conversation?

We say we're a church of Jesus followers that gather and then go.

Are you actually taking the gospel with you?

Or are you comfortable leaving it in this church box here?

I want to be a pastor.

I want us to be a church that is more focused on what is happening in our families and in the people closest to us and in our community than what happens in this room.

Is it important that we teach scripture properly?

Yes.

Is it important that we worship God properly?

Are those things important?

Yes, yes and yes but if it just stays in here then man we're missing the mark.

For us parents the scriptures say train up a child in the way they should go and when they are old they won't depart from it.

We need to understand and realize that we are training them right now by the decisions we make by the choices we make by what we do and what we do not do we are training them.

Are you training them that we just went to church on Sundays we just prayed before meals or are you training them in the scriptures teaching them the scriptures are you reading and singing the scriptures to them on a daily basis to paraphrase from author Joel Beake it would be criminal to not feed your children on a daily basis so why do we as Christians and Christian parents not feed our children the word of God daily that should be even more deadly in fact I think it is so is the gospel just a convenience for you or are you willing to as it told us at the end of the chapter shake the dust off your feet to reject the ways of this world to reject the things of this world to look different and be different because you can look at your family history you can look at the world around us I don't want to be quite normal I don't want to be of the status quo in fact I want to resonate with the words of Jesus when he says they hated me so they're going to hate you and if I'm being honest I think sometimes I would rather be liked than hated I would rather be liked by the world people won't hate you if you do what they do you get hated for being obedient to God for choosing his ways and not yours for being submitted to scripture because it is the word of God action should make you uncomfortable with how easy we have it let's use that to our advantage and not just sit on our hands and be comfortable with just coming to church on Sundays coming to things and yeah I'm here but I'm kind of checked out I'm here but I'm thinking about X Y and Z and yeah we've got stuff going on yeah life happens but let us be people who live on mission for Jesus Christ and that starts with the relationships closest to us and works its way outward so what kind of Jesus conversations are you having who are you witness to witnessing to how are you encouraging your spouse towards Christ how are you drawing together towards Jesus is it happening is it happening with your children is it happening with your friends is it happening with your co-workers and the people you see on a regular basis I don't want us to just be Jesus followers who gather but we must go we must go and if you are a believer in Jesus Christ that is what God has called us to that is what God has called you to to go would you pray with me this morning God we thank you for your word we thank you that it is truth Lord would you help us to be people who worship you in spirit and in truth would you help us to live our lives in full devotion to you God would you fill us with your spirit so that we can speak boldly about you so that we can have tough conversations so that we can proclaim your name to the people that we love the people that we see on a regular basis Jesus we love you so much we thank you that you have called us and chosen us we thank you that we get to worship you it's in Jesus name everyone said amen amen
