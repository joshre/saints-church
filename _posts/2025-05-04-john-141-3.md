## Transcription

Well, good morning.

We are starting John chapter 14 today.

And this morning, why don't we read, let's read all the chapter.

John chapter 14.

And then we'll go from there.

Let not your hearts be troubled, believe in God, believe also in me.

In my Father's house are many rooms.

If it were not so, I would have told you that I go to prepare a place for you.

And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that there I am, you may be also.

And you know the way to where I am going.

Thomas said to him, Lord, we do not know where you are going.

How can we know the way?

Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth and the life.

No one comes to the Father except through me.

If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.

From now on, you do know him and have seen him.

Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father and it is enough for us.

And Jesus said to him, have I been with you so long and you still do not know me, Philip?

Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.

How can you say show us the Father?

Do you not believe that I am the Father and the Father is in me?

The words that I say to you, I do not speak of my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his work.

Believe in me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on the account of the works themselves.

Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do.

And greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father.

Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.

If you love me, you will keep my commandments.

And I will ask the Father and he will give you another helper to be with you forever.

Even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him.

You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.

I will not leave you as orphans.

I will come to you.

Yet a little while and the world will see me no more.

But you will see me because I live.

You will also live.

And that day you will know that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you.

Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he is who loves me.

And he who loves me will be loved by my Father.

And I will love him and manifest myself to him.

Judas, not Iscariot, said to him, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world?

Jesus answered him, if anyone loves me, he will keep my word.

And my Father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him.

Whoever does not love me does not keep my words.

And the word that you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.

These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you.

The helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and will bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.

Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you.

Not as the world gives, not as the world gives do I give to you.

Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.

You heard me say to you, I am going away and I will come to you.

If you loved me, you will have a choice because I'm going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.

And now I have told you before it takes place so that when it does take place, you may believe.

I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming.

He has no claim on me, but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father.

Rise, let us go from here.

Awesome.

A chapter like this gives me hope because the disciples who are with the incarnate Jesus, the actual Jesus, they still don't get it.

And that is encouraging for times where I don't get it.

This morning we're just going to be looking at the first three verses, because if we carry on from there, there's a whole nother can of worms, and I only want to deal with one can this morning.

And yes, let me read it for you, and then we'll go from there.

So starting back at verse one, let not your hearts be troubled, believe in God, believe also in me.

In my Father's house are many rooms.

If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?

And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will take you to myself, that where I am, you may be also.

Why are their hearts troubled?

Betrayal, of course.

We have to remember chapters and verses were added much, much later for our reading pleasure.

And so when we're reading this, we need to remember the context above, which we'll get to in a second.

But of course, Jesus just told his disciples, right, that one of them is about to betray him.

And then there's murmuring, and we're not sure which one, and they're not sure which one.

Well, we're sure which one, we know, but they don't know.

And then Judas gets up and leaves, and then there's confusion among them.

What's he going to do?

Oh, he's getting the preparations for us.

They have no idea.

And I'm sure you would see Judas get up.

You'd be on the edge of your seat, like, what's going on?

Where's he going?

Like, he didn't say anything, like.

Then Jesus tells them where they are going, where he is going, they cannot follow him now.

And that's 1336.

Where I am going, you cannot follow me now.

Keyword there, obviously, now.

You can't follow me now.

Then Peter speaks up, and he says, Lord, why can I not follow you now?

I will lay down my life for you.

To which Jesus replies, will you lay down your life for me?

Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times.

OK, talk about some tension in the room, right?

Talk about some high intensity moments for these disciples.

Your buddy, who you spent every day with for the last three years, experienced the incredible miracles of Jesus, the incredible ministry of Jesus, and now he's just gone.

Right?

Judas just gets up and goes.

And you're unsure of where he is, where he's going, what he's doing.

And then Peter, one of Jesus's right hand men, is going to deny him, and Jesus tells him he's going to deny him.

Like, this talk about like a tense dinner table.

I'm sure they're there and they're going, OK, what's going to happen next?

What's going on here?

What?

What are we?

What are we doing?

Of course, there's a whole backstop.

Remember Thomas a few chapters ago talks about, oh, yeah, let's let's go into Jerusalem.

That's a safe place.

They don't want to kill you, Jesus.

Let's all go die.

So that that's kind of their thought about going into Jerusalem.

And now they're here in Jerusalem.

And then this whole ordeal goes down.

And then we see Jesus say, let not your hearts be troubled.

Believe in God.

Believe also in me.

So Jesus can feel the tension in the room.

He can sense the anxiety, the worry, the agony, the trouble in the room.

And we went over this word a few weeks ago.

This this do not let your heart be troubled.

That trouble, that word there is like a it's a great distress.

It is it is an it's it's anxiety.

And Jesus says, after all these things happen.

Jesus, don't go straight to freak out.

You're feeling troubled like.

Let's let us remember the truth.

Do not let your hearts be troubled.

Believe in God.

Believe in me also.

Now, we don't get the exact the exact inflection there, like how Jesus exactly said it.

But we could assume that these guys around the table, they were they believed in the God of Israel.

They believed in Yahweh.

They believed in that God.

So that would suggest to us to believe that Jesus is saying to them, you believe in God.

Believe also in me.

So you believe in God.

Believe in me.

Then Jesus starts talking about a house.

Right.

Verse two, in my father's house are many rooms.

If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?

And if I go prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself that where I am, you may be also.

So what we're missing from this verse is a whole lot of cultural awareness and context.

If you were driving down Foothills Parkway and you see a guy and he's.

Reaches in his back pocket and he starts going down on one knee, what's happening?

He's proposing.

So this prepare a place for you language would have been a dead giveaway of talking about the betrothal process in Jewish culture in Jesus's times.

So let's dig a little deeper into that and we'll we'll see how it all plays out.

So of course, the dads have come together.

Here's my son.

I see you have a daughter.

I give you 10 goats. 20 goats. 15.

You have a deal.

There's a there's a there's an arrangement, right?

There's a bride price.

Hey, what does this bride cost?

Then on on the agreement of the bride price, there is a public declaration of the engagement.

OK, so there's it gets posted in the newspaper, right?

Jenny is marrying Mikey.

Jenny from Nazareth is marrying Billy from Bethlehem.

Headline news.

No, it just makes on the back page.

So there's a declaration of the engagement.

And then after that, the engaged.

Groom goes back to his hometown and prepares a place for his family, for him and his wife.

There is a preparation he would he would start to prepare the house for their family and he would build upon the cornerstone of the parents house.

And so the how would we usually work is that there was one main cornerstone and then there were homes sort of built on top of each other that were all sort of around this cornerstone.

And so every home is built on the parents cornerstone.

And so there's this there's the preparation in time that takes place for this building of this of this future husband and wife, their new home.

So it could usually it could take up to a year for these preparations to be made.

And so maybe a year later, your soon to be husband, your fiance comes back to get his bride.

They have the ceremony.

They have all the all the festivities and then they live happily ever after.

OK, let's go back to that one more time just so we can see it even a little clearer.

So there's a bride price, right?

There's a cost to get the bride.

Because we see this we see this analogy laid out, especially a lot sometimes in the Old Testament as well as in the New Testament of the bride and the bridegroom and this Jesus being the groom and his people being the bride.

And so when we're again, that marriage is a is a type, it is a shadow of of the kingdom of God, of of of Jesus and his people.

And so we have the bride price.

Right.

What is it?

What does it cost for the bride?

And of course, God sent Jesus to pay the price for us.

That's what it cost God to get us.

He gave up his son.

He sacrificed his son.

He gave his best for the bride.

Then there's this announcement of the engagement.

Right.

John, chapter one, behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world.

There's an announcement that John the Baptist is preparing the way.

For the groom.

And now what does Jesus say?

In my father's house, there's lots and lots of rooms and a big, big table with lots and lots of food.

A big, big yard where we could play football.

It's a big, big house.

It's my father's house.

And what does Jesus say?

He's going back to his father's house to prepare a place for his disciples.

But more than just for his disciples, but for the church, his bride.

And he is coming back again for his bride.

Let's say even clear.

Jesus is saying, I'm going to my father's house.

Where is Jesus going?

Jesus is going to heaven.

And in heaven, there are many, many rooms.

Heaven is big enough for all of his disciples and for all of us who would come to faith in Jesus now and in the past.

Heaven is big enough for all of us.

There is room and Jesus is going to come back from heaven and bring us to heaven to be with him forever.

So imagine you're one of these guys around the table.

You're anxious.

You're troubled.

Jesus can see it on your face and he tells you, don't let your heart be troubled.

I'm preparing a place for you and I'm coming back for you.

How often do you let your heart be troubled?

How often do you slip into anxiety and spiraling and intrusive thoughts?

Now, this text does not give us an answer for combating those thoughts, but it does give us hope.

Gives us hope.

Gives us hope that Jesus is working on our behalf.

He has prepared a place for you.

Jesus has prepared a place for us.

When I was in middle school, my dad, pretty much from the ground up, he built our family a house.

Now, I didn't ask Janet this, but I can only imagine the sense of comfort and provision she felt seeing her husband build their family a home.

There was this comfort.

There was this feeling of security and safety knowing that he was working hard to prepare a place for her family.

Jesus has prepared a place for us.

For you, for me, his chosen people.

He is building a place for us where we can be forever.

Jesus is working on our behalf.

How often do you remind yourself of that?

That Jesus is working on your behalf.

I know I don't remind myself of that enough.

I still try to work and grind and struggle my way through doing the things that I want to see done.

And here is a story of Jesus in the midst of he's about to take up the cross.

And what does he do with his disciples?

Hey, it's going to be all right.

I'm preparing a place for you.

You can't come with me now, but I'm coming back for you.

Don't worry.

So we can have hope that Jesus is working on our behalf.

We can have hope that Jesus is aware of the human condition.

Jesus is aware of our condition.

These guys didn't say anything.

And Jesus diagnosed what these guys were feeling and spoke directly to them.

Did he give them the answer of exactly what they were looking for?

Probably not.

Because these guys probably did not understand what Jesus was saying at the moment.

And how often do we find that?

Jesus, we're in the middle of something.

We're in the middle of an issue.

We're in the middle of a stressful time.

And Jesus, you know, we're reading in the scriptures or a friend encourages us.

And it's not exactly what we wanted to hear or exactly how we needed it.

But then you kind of take a step back and you start looking around like, yeah, that actually is what I needed to hear.

These guys were afraid.

They were anxious.

And Jesus tells them there's more going on here than you can see, which is a good reminder for you and me.

We need to be reminded that whatever we are going through in this moment is not forever.

Our time on this broken earth is limited.

Our time in pain and suffering is limited.

And sometimes in the midst of our condition, we need to look up toward heaven.

We need to be reminded of eternity.

We need to not miss the forest for the tree.

Be reminded that Jesus sees us.

He has given us a hope and eternity.

I'm reminded of the Psalm that we read this morning that Jesus or that God has commanded his angels to protect us.

That Jesus is our, that God is our refuge and strength.

So we can have hope that Jesus is working on our behalf.

Hope that Jesus is aware of the human condition and hope that Jesus is coming back for us.

Listen to these words again from Jesus.

I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am, you may be also.

On this side of eternity, people like to argue on how and which way we're going to get to heaven.

I couldn't care less.

I just want to get there.

How it happens?

Sure, argue about it all you want.

You don't know either.

What we do know is that he is coming back for us.

And that should change the way we live today.

That should change our outlook on our neighbors, on our communities, on our families, on our friends.

That should completely change our perspective that Jesus is coming back to us and for us.

That should change the way we even look at our Sundays.

That should change the way that we look at this day together.

Where we have a whole week to first off, fight a winning battle.

Jesus came out of the grave.

The enemy is defeated.

And so we can walk with confidence and authority, knowing that the things we're facing with coworkers, with people we interact with at the parks and playgrounds and out and about with our neighbors.

That we can walk into those things with confidence and also know that we can battle and struggle and fight.

And come back to this place on a Sunday morning for refuge and strength and comfort.

To get our battle wounds mended.

There's this thing going around these days where there's people talking about it's one gorilla versus 100 men.

Have you guys seen this or heard this?

There's this internet debate going on right now about if 100 men could beat a gorilla.

And I was listening to a podcast with these guys when they were talking about it and they were talking about how like, okay, let's say this.

Like how is it?

How is the battle starting?

Is it one on one?

Because if it's one on one and that gorilla goes for just one guy and he gets really messed up, beat up, maybe even dead, like that's going to scare off quite a few men.

Sometimes I think how Christians view the world is like that gorilla.

And we see we have one bad interaction with somebody.

And we go, ah, that's it.

I'm just going to stick to my people, stick to my friends.

Sometimes we're afraid to step out into the mission field.

I'm going to read that Psalm again for us from the from the New Living Translation.

If you want to turn there back with me to Psalm 91.

I'm going to read it out of the New Living Translation.

Sometimes Kayla and I will pray together throughout the week.

And this week we just like grabbed a couple of Bibles and one was an NIV and one was an NLT and we were reading this Psalm together.

And obviously there were different translations and so we were like going back and forth and it was kind of a cool comparison.

And there were some things in here that I think as we as we think about.

The hope that we have in Jesus, as we think about the hope that we have when we're stepping out into the world.

And in the New Living Translation there were some things that were just, I'll read it.

Shut up and just read.

Those who live in the shelter of the Most High will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty.

This I declare about the Lord.

He alone is my refuge, my place of safety.

He is my God and I will trust him.

For he will rescue you from every trap and protect you from deadly disease.

He will cover you with his feathers.

He will shelter you with his wings.

His faithful promises are your armor and protection.

Think about that for a moment.

The promises of God that he will never leave you, never forsake you.

The promise that his, that Jesus is coming back for us.

These are our armor and protection.

Do not be afraid of the terrors of the night, nor the arrow that flies in the day.

Do not dread the disease that stalks in darkness, nor the disaster that strikes at midday.

Though a thousand fall at your side.

That gorilla spig.

Though ten thousand are dying around you, these evils will not touch you.

Just open your eyes and see how the wicked are punished.

If you make the Lord your refuge, if you make the most high your shelter, no evil will conquer you.

Why?

Because our Savior is out of the grave.

He's defeated death and darkness.

No plague will come near your home.

For he will order his angels to protect you wherever you go.

They will hold you up with their hands so you won't even hurt your foot on a stone.

You will trample upon lions and cobras.

You will crush fierce lions and serpents under your feet.

The Lord says, I will rescue those who love me.

I will protect those who trust in my name.

When they call on me, I will answer.

I will be with them in trouble.

I will rescue and honor them.

I will reward them with a long life and give them my salvation.

The Lord says, I will rescue those who love me.

I will protect those who trust in my name.

When they call on me, I will answer.

I will be with them in trouble.

I will rescue them and honor them.

I will reward them with a long life and give them my salvation.

Jesus is coming back to take us from this broken and messed up world.

And we will get to be with him in heaven forever.

We get to be with Jesus.

Now...

That psalm we just read, some people would really like to take it and make it say like, So you're not going to get sick?

You're not going to lose your job?

Things aren't going to be hard?

And that's a terrible translation of that text.

Because in a couple chapters, Jesus will tell us...

That...

Oh my gosh, I just blanked.

John 16, 33.

It's in my head, but I can't remember the exact...

Here in this world you will have trouble, but take heart, I have overcome the world.

That's what he said.

In this world you will have troubles, but take heart, I have overcome the world.

I think we are all familiar with pain and suffering at some point.

But we have a God who is with us now.

And just as we read in chapter 14, Jesus has sent his spirit to be with us and is in us.

Jesus, God is with us.

Those promises are true.

And so don't be discouraged.

Don't be afraid when life sucks and life is hard.

And things aren't always going your way.

Do not be discouraged.

Do not be troubled.

Believe in God.

Believe also in Jesus.

You believe in God.

You also believe in Jesus.

That means we need to take him at his word.

We need to trust in the word and the promises of God.

And so this morning, with whatever you're going through, with whatever this week has for you, whatever last week did to you and for you, would you have hope that Jesus is working on your behalf?

Hope that Jesus is aware of your condition and hope that Jesus is coming back for us.

May that not be your last word.

And I hope that you are all aware of that.

And I hope that you are all with us.

May that not just be a rah-rah, hoot and holler on Sunday morning.

But may we take that into our week.

That we can have the hope and confidence of a risen Savior.

That Jesus is with us.

That his promises are our armor and protection.

That Jesus is our shield and our refuge and that he is with us in trouble.

Whatever you need to do this week to remind yourself of those things.

Maybe you just write yourself out a little mantra.

Maybe you need to read Psalm 91 every morning this week.

Whatever it is to keep you in that victorious state.

Do it.

Because Jesus tells us, do not let your hearts be troubled.

Believe in me.

Believe in me also.

He is going to prepare a place for us.

And he's coming back for us.

And that is really good news.

And that is hope.

Hope for you and for me.

And so this week, let us be filled with the hope of a risen Savior who is coming back for us.

So pray with me.

Jesus, we thank you for your word.

We thank you for your promises.

We thank you for your protection.

Jesus, help us to live this week with the hope and confidence of a risen Savior.

With the hope and confidence of your protection.

Help us to not be discouraged.

Help us to not be overcome.

Jesus would, you lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

And so we thank you for your word.

We thank you for your word.

We thank you for your word.

We thank you for your word.

We thank you for your word.

We thank you for your word.

It's in Jesus' name.

Everyone said, Amen.
