## Transcription

All right, well I hope you had a great Christmas and it's good to see you this morning.

If you're like me and lost track of time, today is Sunday.

I feel like whenever the holidays come around it's like I just lose all sense of time and days and it's just like...but we're here.

It's Sunday morning.

It's good to see you.

We're gonna jump into Acts chapter 9.

We've been going chapter by chapter through the book of Acts and this is our ninth week.

Actually no, because the first couple chapters we've went verse by verse like we usually do.

So I couldn't tell you how many weeks it's been, but it's been a few.

And before we jump into that I just want to quickly remind you that we have a prayer gathering January 7th, 7 p.m.

First Wednesday of every month including January.

So start your new year off with prayer.

That would be wise.

That would be wise.

So our prayer and worship gathering January 7th, 7 p.m. right in this space, right in this place.

Acts 9.

Okay, that's where we are this morning.

Acts chapter 9.

And before we get in there, just to kind of recap on the first eight chapters or so.

Acts chapter 9, we kind of see a turning point in the book of Acts.

The first eight chapters, seven and a quarter, seven and a half, are really focused in on the Jesus movement happening in Jerusalem.

And then that kind of starts to spill out in chapter 8 out to Judea and Samaria.

And Acts 9 and on is really kind of, Jerusalem's obviously mentioned and we'll see it, but the focus is really the proclamation of the gospel in Samaria and the end of the earth, as Acts 1.8 tells us.

That's kind of the key verse, the key summary of the book of Acts, Acts 1.8.

But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

And so the gospel is advancing.

The people of God are growing and expanding, even in the midst of persecution and hardship and scattering.

And they kept pressing on and they kept being obedient to God and this mission that he had given to them.

And so as we open up in Acts chapter 9, that's what we're going to see this morning.

And particularly in focus is this guy named Saul, or later we'll know him as Paul.

Not King Saul from the Old Testament, who tried to kill David and Saul was the first king of Israel.

Not that king.

We're looking at a different guy, not a king.

His name is Saul, also Paul.

We could get into why Saul, Paul, but we're not.

So if you want to, you can look that up on your own.

It's just different.

It's just different languages.

His name changed.

And so he's going by Paul instead of Saul, but it's the same name, same guy.

Okay.

Acts 9 verses 1 through 2.

That's funny.

Here we go.

Verses 1 through 2.

But Saul, or Paul, still breathing threats and murders against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

Okay.

So our first question is, who is Saul?

Saul is a Hebrew of Hebrews.

He was part of the Pharisees, which the Pharisees were a conservative Jewish group that were devoted to the scriptures.

That's who they were.

That's how they kind of came to power.

They were like, us as Israelites, we are not following the scriptures and we need to.

And so that's what they were all about, was following the scriptures.

Of course, the Old Testament and to God.

And so Saul was part of this group.

Saul was also a Roman citizen, which will come in handy for later on in his ministry and his work and after his conversion.

But he was not ethnically Roman.

He was a Jew.

He was a devout Jew.

He was part of this group of Jews called the Diaspora, which was just the Jews that were all in the sort of Roman world.

They were not in Jerusalem or Judea, but they were in the surrounding areas.

And so Saul was born and grew up in Tarsus, which is quite a ways away from where we are in the story, which is why I have a map for you.

Let's see if we can see that.

Oh yeah, we can see that kind of.

I can see it at least.

So right now they are in Jerusalem.

This is where that is, Jerusalem right there.

Tarsus is all the way at the top of the screen.

And then we'll see Saul in this chapter.

He's on his way from Jerusalem all the way to Damascus, but something catches him along the way right here.

Somebody sets him a really hard screen.

Sorry, I just, all the sports in me.

Okay.

At any rate, that's, so right now we're in Jerusalem.

That's here.

And he's going to, on his way up to Damascus, which is over here.

And he's convicting anyone belonging to the way, which, who is the way?

The way is what we learned that they call these early Christians.

And they get that from Isaiah 40 chapter three and all other passages in Isaiah, which speak of the Lord on his way to restore Israel.

So that's kind of the perspective vantage point that these believers had, these Jesus believers had about themselves and kind of the, the, uh, they're known for in the community is the way they are saying that Jesus is the way to restore Israel.

They were right on the money.

And Luke is saying that this is the, this is what the early church is known for.

They're known as the way that Jesus is the way that he is the way of restoring Israel through his life, death, and resurrection.

And that Jesus is the Messiah, the exalted Lord and Savior, and that this community of people and followers of Jesus is this way.

They are the way because they are pointing and showing the way to Jesus, who is the way, the truth, and the life.

Now, as he went on his way, verse three, he approached Damascus and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him and falling to the ground.

He heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?

And he said, who are you, Lord?

And he said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, but rise and enter the city and you will be told what you are to do.

Okay.

So Saul is on his way to persecute these Christians in Damascus.

He's gotten the approval from the, from the chief priest, from the high priest to, to, uh, imprison them, to, to drag them to Jerusalem, to break them up.

And then suddenly he has stopped dead in his tracks and the heavenly light is shining around him.

It's funny here.

If we were to kind of look back to Acts chapter two, uh, the word that Luke uses when the spirit falls is suddenly and suddenly the spirit falls.

And then here again, we see the here in Acts, it says, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him and he has stopped dead in his tracks.

A heavenly, a heavenly light is shining around him.

And his response is to fall on the ground.

And then he hears a loud voice say, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?

And, uh, as anyone normal would, he says, knock, knock.

Who's there?

Who are you, Lord?

And then Jesus replies, right?

He says, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?

It's a very interesting note here that Jesus is saying, why are you persecuting me?

When had Jesus was already ascended into heaven?

And so Saul had not physically laid a hand on Jesus, but yet Jesus's response is, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?

And of course he is persecuting his people, the bride, his church.

And so it's like when the believers are being persecuted, it's like Jesus is being persecuted, which I think we all would somewhat know this or understand this.

It's like, if you mess with my wife, you're messing with me, right?

If you come after my wife, you're coming after me.

If you come after my family, you're coming after me.

And this is the kind of picture, this is the connection and the relationship and the intimacy that we see that Jesus has with his people.

Although a finger has not been laid on Jesus by Saul, he is persecuting his bride.

He is hurting and harming his bride.

And so therefore, Jesus says, why are you persecuting me?

You've messed with me.

If you are a believer, you can take comfort.

You can take rest in knowing that our Savior, our Redeemer, is protecting us.

Jesus also gives Saul a task to do.

He says, but rise, and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.

Let's continue on.

Verse 7.

The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.

Hearing the voice, but seeing no one.

Saul rose from the ground, and although his eyes were opened, he saw nothing.

So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.

And for three days, he was without sight, neither ate nor drank.

So Paul's buddies who are traveling with him, they hear this interaction, but they don't see any of it.

So they're just kind of like semi-witnesses to this whole interaction, and they're shook.

And later in 1 Corinthians, Paul will argue that he is an apostle because he had this interaction with Jesus.

Because Jesus became manifest to him, and he had this extraordinary encounter with Jesus.

And somehow, in that heavenly light, he must have seen Jesus.

Why can we assume that?

Well, one, because Saul says so.

And also, we see that the men don't see anything, but Saul says that he saw Jesus.

And so, these men, they lead Saul to Damascus, and he's there for three days fasting.

He's not eating or drinking or seeing.

This is kind of a even crazier fast.

Let me see you go on the Saul fast.

Everyone talks about the Daniel fast.

How about the Saul fast?

Go get yourself some glasses where you can't see, and get around for three days.

That's funny.

All the while, while Saul is doing this, we see what God is working on on the other end.

And the other believers in Damascus.

Let's continue on.

Verse 10.

Now, there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias.

The Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias.

And he said, Here I am, Lord.

And the Lord said to him, Rise and go to the street called Street.

And at the house of Judas, look for a man of Tarsus named Saul.

For behold, he is praying.

And he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias.

Come in and lay his hands on him, that he might regain his sight.

But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem.

And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.

Just imagine being Ananias here.

You're just one of these early believers in Damascus.

You're doing your thing.

You're following Jesus.

Everything's great, if you will, doing whatever job you have.

And then you get this vision.

And then God's like, Hey, there's this guy from Tarsus named Saul.

I need you to go find him and meet him.

And you're going to lay hands on him.

And when you lay hands on him, he's going to regain his sight.

And then you're Ananias and you're like, Hold on.

Did you just say Saul?

Are you sure you got the right guy?

That's the guy that people were laying their cloaks at his feet when they stoned Stephen.

This is him?

He's the bad guy.

He's like public enemy number one.

We do not like this guy.

Are you sure you got the right guy, God?

And then we see it in the text.

In this vision, right before verse 12, it says, A man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying.

It's almost like we get this detail, like God, the vision, that is like, Yes, it's Saul, but don't worry, he's praying.

He's chill.

He's cool.

He's one of us.

Ananias is still like, Hey, God, I hear you.

That's awesome.

I'm glad he's praying.

But you know, I don't, this just doesn't pass the vibe check.

But then the text continues.

Verse 15 says, But the Lord said to him, Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.

For I will show him how much he must suffer for my sake, for my name, for the sake of my name.

We mentioned it earlier, but in Acts 1.8, we get the mission of the church, the purpose of the book of Acts, right, to receive the Holy Spirit and to be Jesus' witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the ends of the earth.

And that's the commission that Jesus has given his people then and as well us now.

And it seems like here in verses 15 and 16 that Saul kind of gets his own sort of side quest, his own sort of, commission as a part of the great commission and his own task as part of building Jesus' church, right?

The text tells us that he is a chosen instrument.

He is a chosen instrument.

He is an instrument in the hands of Jesus to be used for Jesus' purposes.

And for what purpose? to proclaim my name for the Gentiles, kings, children of Israel.

So to Jew and Gentile, Saul is going to be sent and as well as to suffer for the sake of my name.

Saul made those who called on the name of Jesus suffer by arresting and interrogating and punishing them.

And now, Saul will suffer for the sake of Jesus' name now as Christ represented it.

Jesus had a plan for Saul and Saul or and God made that plan clear to Ananias.

Verse 17.

So Ananias departed and entered the house and laying his hands on him, he said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me to you that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.

And something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight.

Then he rose and was baptized and taking food he was strengthened.

I just I wonder how different I would be how different you would be if we obeyed the Lord like Ananias did.

God asked him to do something that is uncomfortable something that's flat out scary something that he would was not willing to do and yet he did it anyways. how many times has maybe God nudged you or you thought ah yeah I better go give that person who's homeless I better go actually go buy him a burger or do something for them and then you just drive on past. you don't trust you don't trust that inkling because it's inconvenient because it's uncomfortable I wonder how different you and I would be I wonder how much easier it would be to be obedient to the Lord and I wonder how less shameful life would be if we forgave the people that we have not yet forgiven if we apologized for our actions if I just wonder how different things would be if we actually did what the scriptures and what our Lord and Savior is asking us to do. that's what we see here in this moment with Ananias and Saul and in the church and because of Ananias actions the church is forever changed because of it and I'm not saying that your actions or lack of actions will change the course of history that's not what I'm saying here God is too sovereign and too in control to put the weight of humanity on your shoulders but your actions do matter our obedience does matter verse 19 continues for some days he was with the disciples at Damascus and immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues saying he is the son of God and all who heard him were amazed and saying is not this the man who made a havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name and has he not come here for this purpose to bring them bound before the chief priests but Saul increased all the more in strength and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ okay so we see Saul baptized and then he stays with these believers in Damascus and joins into whatever the church looked like and whatever they had going on there as well as evangelizing and proclaiming the name of the gospel or the name of Jesus it's pretty fair to presume that Paul had a great understanding and education in the things of Judaism he was like we mentioned earlier a Hebrew of Hebrews he was part of the Pharisees he had an amazing understanding of the scriptures but we could also assume that he had a great understanding of the way he had a great understanding of these Jesus believers and Jesus followers because you don't just go around persecuting and accusing if you do not have good grounds to do so so he knew what they believed about Jesus or else he wouldn't have made a fit about it if he thought it was not worth it so we could assume that Paul had a great understanding of who these people thought Jesus was and is and what this new movement was all about and if we were looking in Galatians chapter 1 Paul will tell us how he consulted no one or did not go straight to Jerusalem to meet with the apostles he was sent on mission by Jesus and he went he did it verse 23 continues when many days had passed the Jews plotted to kill him but their plot became known to Saul they were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall lowering him in a basket and we get this sort of summary here of because of context clues and other passages in scripture that this period of when many days had passed is to and the end of verse 25 and verse 26 we can assume it's about a three year period why well because in Galatians Paul tells us that three years after his conversion then he goes to Jerusalem which leads us to the next verse in Acts chapter 9 and when he had come to Jerusalem so those few verses there of him being converted to Christianity and his time in Damascus and the surrounding region is about three years because in Galatians Paul tells us that after three years then he goes to Jerusalem and he confronts Peter and James verse 26 and when he had come to Jerusalem he had attempted to join the believers and they were all afraid of him for they did not believe that he was a disciple could you imagine okay so you hear this guy Saul well you know this guy Saul he helps and participates in the martyrdom of your buddy Stephen then he's on his way out to Damascus and then you hear of him getting saved in Damascus this encounter with Jesus then he's preaching Jesus in the synagogues in the surrounding areas and then like probably don't hear nothing from him for three years they're like is this legit what's going on here and then he comes to Jerusalem and so they're like what are you doing here dude like stay back we you're not welcome here would you be like these disciples where you're like nah nah I'd rather I'd rather not mess with you like you can just you do your thing we'll do our own thing or would you embrace him with open arms you'd probably embrace him with open arms just kidding you wouldn't you'd be more reserved but Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord who spoke to him and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus so he went in and out among them at Jerusalem preaching boldly in the name of the Lord and he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists but they were seeking to kill him and when they brought and when the brothers learned this they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus so Barnabas this son of encouragement as we learned a few chapters ago they took him he was like you know what I'll go meet the guy I'll do it and then the things that are important to Luke in recording this the first thing that's important to Luke is that Saul saw the Lord declared them on how the road he had seen the Lord he had an encounter with Jesus on this road to Damascus probably pointing out that Saul was one of Jesus followers and now he had seen him after his resurrection then he explains that this risen Jesus had spoken to him the Lord who spoke to him then lastly Luke points out that Saul was in Damascus and he preached boldly in the name of Jesus he's making the point here that Saul was committed to Jesus and how he even preached Jesus to the point of escaping death not just once but we'll see multiple times and so because of this testimony the apostles and in Galatians as I mentioned earlier it tells us that it's Peter and James which if we were to look at Galatians and see what Paul is arguing about and what he went to Jerusalem for it's you know it's really great thing and it's really important but that's not the point of Acts it's not the point of the scriptures here and but Luke goes like yeah that doesn't matter right now what matters is that he was preaching boldly in the name of Jesus that that the gospel was advancing and then the text tells us that they tried to kill Saul again no like and Saul was a Pharisee a Pharisee preaching about Jesus does not look good on your resume and so when they learned about them wanting to kill Saul they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus verse 31 so the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it multiplied right like the antagonist was now converted to the way and they experienced peace in the church right in the whole church not just the church in Jerusalem but the big sea church was being built up amazing praise God verse 32 now when Peter went here and there among them all he came down to the saints who lived at Lydda and there he found a man named Aeneas bedridden for eight years who was paralyzed and Peter said to him Aeneas Jesus Christ heals you rise and make your bed and immediately he rose and all the residents Lydia and Sharon saw him and they turned to the Lord okay so now in the verses in the text Peter enters the scene and he's traveling throughout Judea and Samaria and he's preaching the gospel and he comes upon this man and he heals him and he tells him to make his bed which some of you might need to take that message to heart if you got working legs get up make your bed at any rate he immediately rose and all the residents of Lydda and the region of Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord verse 36 now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha which translated meaning Dorcas I would probably go by Tabitha too she was full of good works and acts of charity in those days she became ill and died and when they had washed her they laid her in an upper room since Lydda was near Joppa the disciples hearing that Peter was there sent two men to him urging him please come to us without delay so Peter rose and they went with them and when he arrived they took him to the upper room all the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them but Peter put them all outside and knelt down and prayed and turning to the body he said Tabitha arise and she opened up her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat up and he gave her his hand and raised her up then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive and it became known throughout all Joppa and many believed in the Lord and he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon a tanner okay so Luke gives us these two kind of healing stories back to back and let's note here that in both circumstances and all throughout the book of Acts healings always led to salvation and an increase in the church the focus was never on those who are healed or those doing the healing the focus was always on salvation and the increase in the church but as we close this morning there's a verse that I want to highlight and we kind of breeze right past it and I did that on purpose so you might have missed it and if you did well you won't anymore verse 31 so so the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it multiplied I want to focus in on the last section on the last part of this verse here walking in the spirit or walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it multiplied what does it mean to walk in the fear of the Lord what does that mean I think the fear of the Lord is best described in Deuteronomy where God had already given the Israelites and Moses the Ten Commandments and then Moses comes down from the mountain holding the two tablets and as he gets down to the mountain as he comes down from the mountain he sees Aaron and the Israelites and a golden calf and they're worshipping this golden calf and Moses in all frustration and anger he drops down the tablets and they break apart and so now in Deuteronomy we get a do-over and the Israelites get the tablets again and as they're getting the tablets these are God's words and his reply to Israel Deuteronomy 10 verses 12 through 13 and now Israel what does the Lord your God require of you but to fear the Lord your God to walk in all his ways to love him to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and to keep the commandments and statutes of the Lord which I am commanding you to fear the Lord your God how does that play out to walk in all his ways not some of his ways not just the ways that you like but in all his ways how do we know his way his word so are you in the word how else to love him how do we love God by recognizing seeing all that he has done for us and following his example of love of sacrifice and obedience to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul fearing the Lord loving God serving the Lord with all your heart and with all your soul it's not like a like a Chipotle burrito bowl where you pick and choose whatever you want take white rice chicken veggies extra guac that's not what it looks like to fear the Lord to walk in his ways to love him to serve him to just pick the things that we want the things that we like the things that we desire that's not how we serve God you serve your God with all your heart and with all your soul it's all of you and unfortunately it's common for us to treat God and treat our relationship with God kind of like that Chipotle line I'll take a little bit of this and a little bit of that oh you know church isn't really meeting my needs these days so I'll just make time when it's convenient man life is so hard right now things just are really tough I just let me turn to the bottle let me doom scroll for hours because it's just easier because it's just it numbs the pain giving your whole heart and your whole soul to God is inconvenient and it requires a full on sacrifice and if we were honest we don't like sacrifice keep the commandments and statutes of the Lord maybe you've heard of the Jefferson's Bible where Thomas Jefferson he cut out parts of the Bible where it talked about Jesus's divinity and he kept parts of the Bible that spoke of Jesus's morality which might work for government but it definitely doesn't work for Christianity and what I've come to understand in my own life is that I keep the wrong things our problem is that we are keeping the wrong things you see we ought to be keeping the commandments and statutes of the Lord but instead we keep our emotions oh that just doesn't feel right you keep your preferences well I'd just rather not do this you keep your comfort it's just really hard for me to do this so I'll just stay comfortable you keep convenience rather than keeping his commands and I think part of the problem is we think the commands of the Lord are burdensome when the commands are for your good God is not a party pooper if we believe that God is our creator that he has created us that he's made us that he's knit us together in our mother's womb then we ought to trust his word because creator knows his creation and he's given us his commands for our good and for our flourishing and yet how often do we forget disobey or flat out ignore the commands of God we cannot keep the law perfectly that's why God sent Jesus we all come from Adam that's why he sent a second Adam and that's Jesus but that does not mean that we just say oh we've got grace thank you Jesus now live and let live no Jesus did not die for your sin so you can continue to be a sinner he has put his spirit inside of you to conform you to his image and likeness we need to be awoken to how we don't fear God because if you really feared God you would obey him not because you are like a dog with its tail between its legs afraid approaching its master no but because similarly to Saul when he was on that road to Damascus suddenly he had an encounter with the living God and he fell to his to the ground he was stopped in his tracks he obeyed we need to feel the light of the Lord uncover your imperfection and your humanity and all you can do is just do what he says you understand and realize that you are so small compared to the might and the majesty and the glory of a perfect God and so our response is submission and sacrifice you respond by obedience and worship we have gotten too comfortable with our sin that we are uncomfortable in the freedom and the comfort that comes from the Holy Spirit I'm going to say that again because I thought it was really good you have gotten too comfortable with your sin that you are uncomfortable in the freedom and comfort that comes from the Holy Spirit some of you may know some of you may not know I've torn both of my Achilles and the boot that I've worn both times didn't realize I was going to use it twice but that's another story for another time the boot that I wore it went up right to the bottom of my knee and I wore that boot for way too long and I remember when I got to take off that boot and not wear it anymore I was like man I feel lighter it felt weird without the boot because I got used to the pain I got used to the process I got used to my humanity and then when everything healed and I was able to walk again on two feet it was weird it was uncomfortable sometimes that's how we are we've gotten so used to our way of life we've gotten so used to the the darkness that the light is too much to bear so how do we get to freedom and comfort how do we get to freedom and comfort very quickly repent we need to admit where you are sinning against God and return to him that's what repentance is it is returning back to God we need to repent admit where you are sinning against God we need to confess some of you need to confess some things not only to God but maybe potentially to a spouse or an elder or your pastor we need to obey we need to live in obedience do what God says keep his command let go of whatever you were holding on to and keep his command instead you know what's going to happen watch the spirit comfort you watch whatever worst case scenario you were playing out in your head not happen watch you become built up not because you are great but because your trust is in your savior instead of yourself let me pray for us Jesus I thank you for who you are we thank you that you are our comforter you are our advocate and Lord we're sorry for the times and moments where we find comfort more so in ourselves and in the things of this world rather than in you would you reveal to us where we don't fear you how we don't fear you and may you lovingly lead us to repentance lead us to confession and lead us to obey you we cannot do that on our own and we will stumble and fall on our way to there Lord help us to trust you in Jesus name everyone said amen and amen
