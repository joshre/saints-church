Let's turn our Bibles to Acts chapter 2.

That's where we'll be at this morning.

Acts chapter 2, verses 14 through 41.

I'm going to read it quickly for us and then we will jump right in.

Acts chapter 2, starting at verse 14.

But Peter, standing with the leaven, lifted up his voice and addressed them, Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give ear to my words.

For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it's only the third hour of the day.

But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel.

And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams, even on my male servants and female servants.

In those days I will pour out my Spirit and they shall prophesy.

And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.

The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood.

Before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.

And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

Men of Israel, hear these words.

Jesus of Nazareth, a man arrested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst.

As you yourselves know, this Jesus delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God.

You crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.

God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.

For David said concerning him, I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.

Therefore, my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced.

My flesh also will dwell in hope, for you will not abandon my soul to Hades or let your Holy One see corruption.

You have made known to me the paths of life.

You will make me full of gladness with your presence.

Brothers, I say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us this day.

Being therefore a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne.

For he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.

This Jesus God raised up and of that we are all witnesses.

Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.

For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.

Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.

Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brothers, what shall we do?

And Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off.

Everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.

And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.

So those who received his words were baptized and there were added that day about three thousand souls.

So the book of Acts is about one third documented sermons.

And so as I preach this morning, I get to preach on a sermon.

And so that's kind of fun.

And we can very easily just kind of feel like flies on the wall and kind of want to feel and wonder what the scene was and what all that looked like.

But this morning, I want to challenge you to not think of it from that perspective or to see or hear this sermon from that perspective.

But I want you to be like to picture yourself as one of those who is hearing this actually taught.

That you yourself might kind of picture yourself as one of these first century Jews who witnessed these not so sophisticated people speaking your language with clarity, as it tells us in the 13 verses prior.

And declaring of the mighty works of God.

And as it tells us in verse 12, And they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, What does this mean?

But others, mocking said, They are filled with new wine.

So maybe you're one of these over here that sees this mighty works of God and you're amazed and perplexed.

Or I actually give you permission this morning to maybe see these people as drunk.

Your choice.

That's a joke.

There's no judgment here.

Let me pray for us this morning.

Father, open our ears to hear your word and eyes to see you.

Spirit, would you convict us as we are here to know more of you and to be formed into your image.

Would you help us, Lord?

It's in Jesus' name, everyone said.

Okay, let's jump back into verse 14.

But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them.

Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give ear to my words.

For these people are not drunk, as you suppose.

Gotcha.

Since it's only the third hour of the day.

We're not going to get into timing and everything.

It's not 3am.

It's about 9am.

So Peter stands up.

He addresses the crowd.

And again, like we said, we don't fully understand how many people are there.

We know at least a minimum 3,000.

Because at the very end of this, it tells us 3,000 were added to their number that day.

So, at minimum 3,120.

Because there were 120 of them altogether that were filled with the Spirit.

Anyways.

But I don't want us to miss this right here.

Peter says, Give ear to my words.

Give ear to my words.

How many Sunday mornings do you come into this place or come into a church and everything that the preacher says just goes in one ear and out the other?

I'm not saying this for me.

I'm...

I'm just...

You can go ahead and out.

Listen.

I pray for you.

But let us give ear to the Apostle Peter's words.

That's what we're looking at.

That's what we're reading.

That's what we're studying this morning.

And these words were inspired and filled with the Spirit.

So, if you don't listen, that's your loss, not mine.

Let's turn to verse 16 through 21.

Look there in your Bibles.

It won't be on the screen, but I put a little marker there just in case you are distracted by a text message.

But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel.

And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.

And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.

And your young men shall see visions.

And your old men shall dream dreams, even all my male servants and female servants.

In those days I will pour out my Spirit and they shall prophesy.

And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below.

Blood and fire, vapor of smoke.

The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood.

Before the day of the Lord comes, the great magnificent day.

And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

So, Peter starts his sermon, which before we even start to unpack this, we get to see as the first sermon kind of what a true sermon should look like.

So, we get some points as you're listening to me or any other preacher or pastor.

A sermon should have these elements, for sure.

First, it should be biblical, right?

Like Peter three times quotes the Old Testament.

It should be Christ-centered.

That's what Peter's whole message is all about.

Like if we're not preaching Christ, if Christ is not being taught from the pulpit, then we're up a creek without a paddle.

So, a biblical preaching is biblical.

It's Christ-centered.

It should be bold.

We're not just telling people what they want to hear, right?

Like Paul tells Timothy in 2 Timothy 4 verse 3, For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but have itching ears.

They will accumulate for themselves teaching to suit their own passions.

Preaching should be bold, not just telling people what they want to hear, but fearlessly in calling people to repent.

To see ourselves as broken, sinless, not worthy of this gospel that was given to us as a free gift.

As well as reasonable.

Peter did not just play on the emotions of people.

And this is not to say that emotions are bad, or we cannot teach with emotion.

No, we should.

I should be preaching with my whole self.

But Peter did not just play on the emotions of people.

He actually reasoned with them, with the scriptures, to show the true nature and character of God.

So, let's see here.

So, Peter starts his sermon specifically with the book of Joel, as he tells us.

And specifically, this is Joel 2, where it says, and it was in the last days.

In the last days.

In Peter's time, okay, first century Jews, they would have believed that the spirit had ceased from the time of the prophet Malachi, or Malachi, as I like to say for fun.

And so, the Old Testament canon was closed, and the people of God, and the Lord had become silent to his people.

It was about 400 years or so before this time in the first century.

So, for us, it would be like 2,400 or so years ago.

The voice of the Lord ceased.

The Lord became quiet to his people.

And then came John the Baptist, and then came Jesus.

And so, what Peter is telling these people is, and in the last days.

He's saying, this is the last days.

That God is pouring out his spirit on all flesh.

That these men and women who were gathering, these 120, that they were, when the spirit fell on them in this room, that the last days, it started with Jesus when he came, and it is continuing on with this moment.

And Peter is going to continue to flesh that out for us in this sermon.

But, of course, the end of the quotation for Peter, quoting Joel chapter 2.

For us, it's Acts 2 verse 21.

And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

And maybe the people were asking, what name?

Who is this person that everyone should call on?

I'm glad you asked.

Verse 22 tells us, Men of Israel, hear these words.

Jesus of Nazareth.

Jesus of Nazareth.

Peter's going, This is what the prophet Joel said.

Let me present to you Jesus of Nazareth.

Here's the problem.

And here's the solution.

Jesus of Nazareth, A man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst.

As you yourselves know, This Jesus delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God.

You crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.

God raised him up, Loosing the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be held by it.

So Peter says, So you guys remember this guy, Jesus?

Do you remember him?

Remember all the miracles and signs and wonders that he did in our midst?

Remember how you guys over here, You remember you brought that guy and he was sitting on the mat and you guys lifted him up And he cut a hole in the roof and he dropped him in And then Jesus said, Hey, yeah, you're forgiven.

Walk.

And he gets up and walks.

You remember that guy?

He did all those miracles.

He spit, Created mud and then put it again on that guy's eyes And then he saw all of a sudden.

You guys remember that guy?

Yeah.

God, before the beginning of time, according to his master of plan.

That's why he was crucified.

And killed by you guys.

Yes, he died.

But God raised him from the dead is what Peter is saying.

Loosing the pangs or the sufferings of death.

Because it was not possible for Jesus to be held by it.

Jesus could not stay dead.

Literally, it would have been impossible for Jesus to stay dead.

Why?

Because Jesus was sinless.

As Paul will tell us in Romans, The wages of sin is death.

So if Jesus is sinless, yes, he took our sin upon the cross.

That's why he died.

But if Jesus was sinless, God would be unjust if he allowed perfect Jesus to stay dead.

And so then our sins would not be paid for.

And we would be worshiping a false God if God did not raise Jesus from the dead.

All of this is meaningless.

You might as well go to brunch and then watch football.

But no.

Peter continues.

He says, okay, here's my first point.

I told you the prophet Joel.

Now I'm going to go right for the jugular.

Our favorite guy.

Let's jump to verse 25.

For David said concerning him, I saw the Lord always before me for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken.

Therefore, my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced.

My flesh also will dwell in hope.

For you will not abandon my soul to Hades or hell or let your Holy One see corruption.

You have made known to me the paths of life.

You will make me full of gladness with your presence.

Now Peter begins to reason with them.

He says, don't just take my word for it.

Let's see what David wrote about him.

And here Peter is quoting Psalm 16, which speaks of David, but also speaks of someone greater than David, that God would not allow his Holy One, Jesus, to see corruption or be abandoned to hell.

Let's continue to verse 29.

Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us today.

Peter's going like, hey, David, we know David.

You remember that fifth grade field trip?

We went and saw his tomb.

It's a joke.

Evan got it over here first.

I thought that was funny.

Apparently not.

I got to work on my humor.

Verse 30.

Being therefore a prophet and knowing that God has sworn with an oath to him, that he would set one of his descendants on his throne.

He foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.

This Jesus God raised up, and of that we are all witnesses.

Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.

Here's Peter saying, we know David died.

His tomb is here with us.

And so because of that, David is foretelling of this Holy One to come.

And we know this, because this Jesus, whom God raised from the dead, that these 120 were all witnesses of, this Jesus is at the right hand of God, and we have received his promised Holy Spirit, and that's what you witnessed.

So Peter's going, okay, you guys were amazed and perplexed.

Some of you thought we were drunk.

Let me explain to you what all happened.

Let me tell you about what just happened, and what you have witnessed.

That all this was from Jesus, because Jesus is seated at the right hand of God.

And Jesus told us to go and wait, and that the Spirit would come, and how the Spirit has come, and this is what you have witnessed.

Peter again quotes David.

For David said, For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he said, but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool.

And then Peter quotes David one more time, and then he says right here, verse 36, Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain, that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.

So, Peter's painting this picture.

Here's the prophets.

Here's David.

Here's Jesus.

We're a witness of his resurrection.

All this has come to pass.

Then he addresses everyone.

He says, To the whole house of Israel.

Again, we have to remember the day of Pentecost.

This was one of the celebrations where all of the scattered Jews would try their best to get to Jerusalem.

So everyone's here.

All of the Jews from all around the world at the time.

We're all there.

And so Peter is calling out to them.

Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain, he says.

There's not a doubt in Peter's mind.

He says, For certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified. crucified.

Remember I asked you to picture yourself as one of these men or women who is in the temple at this portion.

You crucified him.

We crucified Jesus.

I'm reminded of the words of the song, How Deep the Father's Love for Us.

Let me read one of the verses for you.

It says, There's more lines to that verse, but I want to hold it right here.

It was my sin that held him there.

We hate that.

We hate sitting and feeling the guilt and shame of our sin.

And we rarely want to sit in that moment.

But I'm telling you this morning, we need to.

We need to sit in this moment.

As Peter will tell us in the next verse, that they were cut to the heart.

We hate being cut to the heart.

But it's the truth.

Because our sin is why Jesus went to the cross.

Your anger, your lust, your selfishness, your pride, your lack of self-control, all the sins we know and the sins we don't, were placed upon Jesus as he went to the cross.

Now here's the whole house of Israel.

And they say to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Brothers, what shall we do?

What shall we do?

You see, when you rightly see Jesus as Christ and Lord, and you rightly see yourself as a sinner, then and only then will you rightly respond.

When you rightly see Jesus as Lord and as Christ, and you rightly see yourself as a sinner, unworthy of the Lord, unworthy of the Christ, then and only then can you rightly respond.

What shall we do?

No excuses, no exceptions, no ifs, ands, or buts.

Just asking, what do I do about this problem?

And Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized, every one of you.

In the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

For the promise is for you, and for your children, and for all who are far off.

Everyone whom the Lord your God calls to himself.

And with many other words he bore witness, and continued to exhort them saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.

So those who received his words were baptized.

And there were added that day about three thousand.

What does it mean to repent?

What does it mean to repent?

What does it mean to repent?

Repentance, the word literally means, changing one's mind, and turning back to God.

You might think repentance is just confession of sin.

I've confessed.

That's good.

Sin's around Jesus.

Cool.

No, it's more than just confession.

Confession.

It's changing your mind.

I used to do this.

I used to think this.

I used to act this.

I give up.

I'm changing my mind.

That is true repentance.

I used to believe this.

I used to think this.

I used to act this.

And now I'm changing my mind, and turning back to God.

That is true repentance.

John Calvin said about this passage here.

I've got the quote on the screen.

It says, When was the last time you felt sorry for your sin?

When was the last time you felt wounded with the feeling of your misery?

You see, this is the beginning of repentance.

That we are disgusted with ourselves.

With our actions.

Where should we go but to God?

To ask for forgiveness and His Spirit to change us.

Because we know we can't change ourselves.

We know we can't act unto the Lord's standards.

Only His Spirit within us.

And so as we close this morning, I don't know, maybe some of you need to be baptized.

That might be next for you.

If so, we can make that happen.

Come talk to me.

If that's next for you.

If that's next for you.

I want us to just take a moment.

In silence.

To give us time for the Spirit to speak to us.

In silence.

I want us to sit in silence and let the Spirit cut us to the heart.

And so, I'm going to give us a few minutes for the Spirit to speak to us in the silence.

And then I'll close this in prayer, but...

Maybe you're like, I don't even know where to start as we are about to get into this.

And so I just want you to ask and respond to the Lord by saying, Lord, reveal to me where I need to repent.

Lord, reveal to me where I need to repent.

And so let's just take some time in silence and...
