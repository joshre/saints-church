description: "Peter is empowered by the Spirit to preach and the people are cut to the heart...\nIn this sermon, we see Peter preach the very first sermon of the early church. He explains what’s happening—the Holy Spirit has come just as the prophet Joel said. Then he points to Jesus, crucified and risen, and calls the people to respond. And they do, they are cut to the heart and ask, “What should we do?” Peter’s answer is clear: repent, be baptized, and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\nThis isn’t just a moment from history—it’s an invitation for us today. What does real repentance look like?"
