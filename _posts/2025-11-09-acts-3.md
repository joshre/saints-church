## Transcription

Well, cool.

Good morning.

I just want to say I'm incredibly honored to be able to have the privilege of serving you all as an elder.

Just a wonderful blessing.

And I know I'm not an expressive person, as I guess everyone knows, but I just wanted to let you know that I love you and I cherish this opportunity of preaching God's word this morning.

And so what we'll be in today, we're just continuing through the book of Acts.

We'll be in Acts 3.

And so I get the privilege to start covering the whole chapter.

So as we go through the book of Acts, we'll go chapter by chapter instead of kind of more of a smaller verse by verse as we've been doing.

And so this one is just chock full of the beauty and the wonder of the gospel.

So we get to see a miracle being worked and then Peter stepping up to preach to those who've gathered.

And so fortunately it worked out well that the first text, the text for my first sermon is itself a sermon.

Yeah.

And so there's a lot happening here.

And so what I'm going to do is going to start with like the fundamental purpose of the text and then we'll read through it, kind of section by section and examine it in more detail.

And so this whole chapter at its essence is a picture of the true function and message of the Christian church.

And the greatest need of the world today is to know the message of the Christian church as much confusion of what this message is in the minds of men and women outside the church.

And this confusion is a great masterpiece of the devil.

We're told that the devil is the enemy of God.

His great ambition is to bring ruin into God's perfect creation.

We see it from the beginning in Genesis 3.

He tempts Adam and Eve, leads to the fall of mankind.

And we see it all throughout the New Testament as the early church faces persecution and stumbling blocks.

And even now the devil is actively trying to destroy the church.

And now one of the greatest devil's achievements is to bring this confusion about the gospel into the church as well.

I mean, there's no surprise that so many outside of the church are confused about this message when in the name of Christianity and the church, there are things being said that are contrary to Scripture.

Churches are promoting a prosperity gospel, a social gospel, like moralistic gospel where Jesus is just a good example.

Just to put it more bluntly, it is a false gospel.

And so it comes to pass that the greatest need today is the need to know exactly what the gospel is.

I mean, what is Christianity?

What is the Christian gospel?

And this is what I'll be focused on this morning.

And so some context before we dig into chapter 3.

In the first two chapters of Acts, we're told of how the church began.

Especially at the end of chapter 2, which we talked about last week, we're given a clear description of the church and the life of believers.

They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, the breaking of bread and prayer.

All came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles.

Day by day, they were attending the temple together, praising God, having favor with all the people.

And then the Lord added to the number day by day those who were being saved.

So this is the description of the nature and the character of the church.

And it's the nature and the character of believers.

And this is what authentic Christianity is.

And it's not my own opinion or theory.

This is an historical fact of the beginning of the Christian church.

Luke is giving us an eyewitness account of how the church started in Jerusalem almost 2,000 years ago.

And then now, as we get into chapter 3, we have the same description of the church, but it's given to us in a picture.

We get to see the church in action.

It's working out itself that is something that is living and real.

And there's always a danger to think just purely theoretical and abstract about either the stories we read in Scripture or these early accounts.

And we must absolutely know theory and doctrine, but we have to be reminded that first and foremost, Christianity is a life.

It is a powerful life, and it's the most revolutionary thing that the world has ever known.

And so the church, again in chapters 1 and 2, it's received the Holy Spirit, and then now in chapter 3, it is facing the world as it is.

And this is the role of the church to face the world as it is.

We are to help the world.

Remember that our own Lord came down from heaven to help men and women.

He came to seek and save those that were lost.

And after He ascended, He left the church behind to continue this work.

But it is still He who is acting, but it's now through His chosen people.

And so now, with all of that, I want to turn your attention to the first 10 verses of this chapter.

So now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.

And a man lame from birth was being carried, and they laid daily at the gate of the temple, that is called the beautiful gate, to ask alms of those entering the temple.

Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms.

And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, Look at us.

And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.

But Peter said, I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you.

In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.

And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.

And leaping up, he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.

And all the people saw him walking and praising God, and recognized him as the one who sat at the beautiful gate of the temple, asking for alms.

And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened.

So first and foremost, we are looking at a miracle.

There's no question about that.

I hope no one here is foolish enough to not believe in miracles.

Because if you believe in God, you must believe in miracles.

But now, what are miracles?

So simply, miracles are events that cannot be explained by natural means.

So miracles are not acts of God that break the laws of nature.

God isn't bound by his own creation.

He can work outside of it if he wishes.

And so all the miracles worked throughout scripture are a manifestation of his lordship and his sovereignty over everything.

As we'll see in chapter 17 of Acts, Paul explains to the Greeks that God himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.

I mean, we all are alive in this room today because God is giving us life.

But now, normally, he works through ordinary means.

I just know a way of saying he works through his providence.

He has wonderfully crafted our bodies to take care of themselves without constant, direct, divine intervention.

It's amazing that our bodies have these natural healing mechanisms.

It's also equally amazing that our minds are intelligent enough to be able to study the bodies, provide treatment and support, and create medicines to further support our bodies.

But again, God is still sovereign over everything.

If it isn't God's will for you to get better, you can have the best treatment in the world and the best doctors in the world, but never get better.

But now, as God works through miracles, he provides glimpses of his power and his glory.

Because Peter, as we'll see through his sermon, was intent on showing the people the purpose of the miracle.

And we often have a tendency to stop at the miracle, to stop at the wonder and the awe of the miracle.

And to be honest, there will be times that we only want the miracle.

But this is to completely misunderstand miracles.

Peter is making it very plain and clear in his sermon what the function and the meaning of the miracle is.

And so, the function and meaning of this miracle is to point to the power and the person of Jesus Christ.

I'll say that again.

The function and meaning of the miracle is to point to the power and person of Jesus Christ.

It is to substantiate and provide authority to the claims that the apostles were making about him.

That he indeed is the Son of God and Savior of the world.

And Peter doesn't end with the miracle.

This isn't the big climactic event after his incredible sermon.

He starts with the miracle and then proceeds to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Because the gospel is what Peter was so eager to tell them.

And now this miracle, like many miracles in the New Testament, it serves as a parable and an illustration of man's natural condition and God's saving power.

So, for example, in John 9, Jesus heals a man born blind.

And then he proceeds to preach about spiritual blindness.

In Matthew 12, Jesus exercises and heals a demon-possessed man.

And then preaches about binding the strong man and having authority over Satan.

And if you recall from this previous year as we're studying John and his gospel, he called miracles signs.

They are meant to teach and to preach to us.

The miracles are absolutely physical and historical events, but they point to a spiritual condition within us and show that only through the person and work of Christ can we be healed.

And as we will see, Peter performs this miracle and then goes on to preach about sin, repentance, and faith in Jesus Christ.

And so then it begs the question, what spiritual condition is this miracle pointing to?

And so this paralyzed man illustrates our natural, sinful condition.

This has classically been called by the church the doctrine of original sin.

And just original just means that sin has been present within humanity ever since the fall.

So once Adam and Eve sinned, all of humanity is now born into sin.

And again, because there's confusion inside and outside the church, what is sin?

So sin isn't a mistake.

Sin isn't simply the bad things that we do.

Sin is a transgression against the law of God.

It is a conscious action against what he has commanded.

And sin stems from a pollution of our soul that causes us to want us to become like God, but by our own strength.

And as Psalm 51 5 says, In sin did my mother conceive me.

We are not born innocent before God.

Even at the moment of conception, our souls and our bodies are polluted by sin.

And we aren't sinners because we sin.

We're not neutral and then fall into like the evil side.

We sin because we are sinners.

And now what can we do in this sinful or paralyzed state?

So if we look back to the man, all that he could do was sit outside the temple and ask for alms of those that were passing by.

He was just asking for money and food of those that had any.

And later on in Acts 4, we're told that this man is over 40 years old.

So he's been carried here day after day after day for 40 years to ask for money and for food.

I mean, I can't only imagine how hopeless the man must have felt.

He's only concerned with receiving handouts so he can get some food, he can get a bit of comfort and then be able to come back again the next day.

He's focused on being able to live a quote-unquote good life in spite of his condition.

He isn't focused on his primary need of walking again.

And he has fallen into a hopelessness that sin inevitably leads to.

And consequently, the world today has lost its focus on its primary need.

It's become hopeless and is focusing on only alms.

It's trying to focus and save itself through technology or try to overcome our human barriers.

It's having people perform like an introspective search so they can find that spark of the divine that's within them.

They can become who they truly meant to be.

Or even to try to create a perfect political system or an economy where all of our material needs are satisfied.

But these are only alms.

They can help people forget about their true problem, but they can never heal a person of their spiritual paralysis.

They can never correct man's fallen nature and inability to walk and work in service to God.

And like the man asking alms of those going into the temple, people often look to the church not for the saving power of the gospel, but for alms.

They look to the church to provide financial support, to officiate weddings and funerals, provide even a place for moral teaching for anyone that wants to come and hear it.

But now this isn't only true for those outside of the church.

This is also true for those inside the church as well.

Because the view of many maybe to come to a church just for fellowship, to be able to meet some people, maybe try to find someone that they want to try to marry, to sing hymns and worship songs, or even just to be able to come, hear a preacher, tell them how to live a better life.

But don't get me wrong.

I mean, these are good things.

These are things the church should do, but it is not the primary task of the church.

It says, Peter says, I have no silver and gold, but I do have, I give to you.

Now there's a negative component within his statement.

He's saying, I have no silver and gold.

He was not equipped to meet the need the man was asking for.

He had no money to give to him.

And similarly, the church isn't equipped to do certain things.

Many look to the church to tell them how to think politically, or to help them advocate for and advance social reform, or even just to be a place where they can hear a lighthearted, you've got this type of speech, so they can feel happy.

The church can only give what has been given to us.

And the primary function of the church is to preach the gospel, is the gospel of Jesus Christ.

And then it's that through faith in his name that our sins may be blotted out and we can be reconciled to God.

And then this good news is what drives us to want to be in fellowship with other saved sinners, to be able to sing praises to our wonderful God, and then to eagerly share this message to those around us.

But these are symptoms and not the primary cause.

Before we keep moving on, I just want to ask this question.

Why are you here?

Is it just for the fellowship?

Is it just for the time of worship?

Is it because your kids have gotten along well with the other ones here, and they enjoy coming?

Or is it because you're aware of this pollution, this paralysis that is within your own soul, and that your only hope is in the name of Jesus Christ?

So the last thing I want to point out about this man is that he still has his legs.

It's not as if he was missing them, and that's clearly the reason he couldn't walk.

He had them.

In verse 7 it says, Immediately his feet and ankle bones were made strong.

They were there, but he was not functioning as God intended and as had he designed.

Because once Adam sinned, it wasn't as if something that made us perfect and holy was cut off from us is now missing.

I mean, we're still image bearers of God.

We still have our morality, our conscience.

We can understand that there are certain actions that are just universally evil, but we are not functioning as God designed.

Romans 3, 10 through 12 tells us, None is righteous, no, not one.

No one understands and no one seeks after God.

All have turned aside and together they have become worthless.

No one does good, not even one.

You and I are paralyzed without Christ.

We have no hope except for him.

And this leads us into Peter's sermon.

So I'm going to cover the first part.

It's going to be verses 11 through 16.

So while he clung to Peter and John, all the people utterly astounded ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's.

And when Peter saw it, he addressed the people.

Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this?

Or why do you stare at us?

As though by our own power or piety, we have made him walk.

The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers glorified his servant, Jesus, whom he delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate when he had decided to release him.

But you deny the holy and righteous one and ask for a murderer to be granted to you.

And you killed the author of life whom God raised from the dead.

To this, we are witnesses in his name, by faith in his name, has made this man strong whom you see and know.

And the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.

I just want to observe real quick in verse 11, How quickly Peter removes all the tension from John and himself.

He asked them, Why do you wonder at this?

Or why do you stare at us?

As they're by our own power or piety, we have made him walk.

He's accurately pinning down the very reasons these people were in awe.

Power and piety were the main focus of these Jews.

And piety is just being a person's devotion or obedience to God's law.

Because the Jews wanted the political power over Rome.

They wanted the outward respect and honor of being pious, but without the internal transformation and love for God.

And this addiction and craving for power and piety was one of the reasons Jesus was crucified.

I mean, if not the main reason.

And now if there was any occasion a preacher might not speak of Christ, I would argue it could be this one.

It could have been said for Peter to not talk of Jesus, as these people just nailed him to a cross about two months ago.

Like, preach the truth, Peter, but don't mention his name.

You'd be sure to give them the doctrine, but withhold the mention of his person.

But Peter, honestly, may even bring an end to his own life if he preaches Christ.

But let them rage as they would.

Peter would tell them nothing but of Jesus Christ.

And now I pray for this boldness and courage for us all.

I mean, he knew this to be the power unto salvation, and he would not flinch from it.

Because this is all he had to give.

But now he wasn't speaking to atheists, pagans, or a people group with some obscure religion.

He was speaking to people that believed in God.

That believed in the same God you and I do.

Peter sees these people rushing in with curiosity and amazement about a miracle, but he doesn't preach on miracles.

He doesn't say you can do this exact same thing with Jesus' help.

Because with great urgency, he wants them to understand their relationship to God.

He doesn't even start with Jesus.

He goes back to the very beginning.

Peter is calling back to God the Father and the patriarchs, the very foundation of the Jewish faith, to show the Jews that this new covenant in Jesus has direct continuity with the Old Testament.

And then in contrast to the honor that God has given to Jesus by glorifying him through resurrection, Peter is pointing out the blatant dishonor that the Jews showed to Jesus.

Now notice his boldness and simplicity in these statements, verses 14 and 15.

You denied the Holy and Righteous One.

You asked for a murderer to be handed to you, and you killed the author of life.

I mean, he's not afraid of being personal.

Because there's a pressure today to not be personal.

To say, I mean, the practice of many is to brush over sin and say that doesn't matter because Jesus loves you and forgives you.

Or to say that you should never feel guilty when sin is brought up.

But this is a gross misunderstanding of the Gospel.

Peter wants these people to know exactly what their standing is before God.

He wants them to understand the weight and the seriousness of what they have done.

To understand the eternal implications of their actions.

As Charles Spurgeon says of Peter, He does not avoid the touching of men's consciences.

He rather thrusts his hand into their hearts and makes them feel their sin.

He labors to open a window into the darkness of their spirits to let the light of the Holy Spirit shine into their souls.

Because Peter is condemning these people with the heaviest of all conceivable crimes.

I mean, you could think that what Peter said is insensitive.

You could think it harsh or offensive.

But what you cannot say is that it is false.

Peter is speaking the raw truth to these people who, in fact, denied the Son of God and killed the author of life.

And we, by extension, we are a part of this mob.

We have killed the Prince of Peace and called for his blood to be shed because of our sin.

Our hatred, our lust, our lack of self-control, our coveting held Jesus to the cross.

All of us deserve death and eternity in hell.

Because from the most self-righteous person to the most heinous murderer, no one can stand before God and say, I have fulfilled your law.

I have loved you perfectly.

I have loved others perfectly.

Our righteousness is put in filthy rags.

And now there is no greater weight than having to come to terms with your sin.

You have to come face-to-face with God, see your wretchedness, and then crumple to the floor because you cannot bear the sight of it.

But Peter, like his glorious and loving Master, will not break the bruised reed.

Peter is showing the Jews the seriousness of their sin out of love.

Because how can they, and then even us today, understand the absolute depth and the power and the grace of Jesus' sacrifice if we don't know the reason why it was necessary?

And I will continue on through Peter's sermon just so that we can see the hope that we have.

And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, this is verse 17, as it also your rulers.

But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled.

Repent, therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all things, about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago.

Moses said, The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.

You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you.

And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.

And all the prophets who have spoken from Samuel and those who came after him also proclaim these days.

You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

God, having raised up his servants, sent him to you first to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness.

So if we look back at 17, Peter isn't mentioning ignorance here to excuse their sin.

Others may see ignorance as their free ticket or free pass or ticket out of hell.

He doesn't do this to excuse their sin, nor to imply that forgiveness is unnecessary, but he does so to show them why forgiveness is possible.

Because although they didn't know what they were doing as they were crucifying Jesus, God knew exactly what he was doing.

Because for what happened to Jesus was the fulfillment of prophecy.

Peter is emphasizing that what had happened had been predicted by the mouth of all of the prophets.

It wasn't just a brief verse or two in Nahum.

How many people are just realizing Nahum is the book of the Bible.

It wasn't just a major prophet like Isaiah, but it was in every single prophet.

The entire Old Testament proclaimed this.

He's pointing out to them that if only you had been diligent students of the word, like the Pharisees and scribes were saying they were, and then actually perceived what was happening, then you would not be surprised by the death of your Messiah, or even participated in calling for his crucifixion.

Now one of the clearest prophecies of Christ's suffering is found in Isaiah 52, 13 through Isaiah 53.

And it's the prophecy that the Messiah would be crucified for our transgressions.

That he would be a suffering servant.

Now this doctrine of a suffering Messiah was completely opposite of the current Jewish views at the time.

Because they expected a Messiah to rise up and overthrow the political power of Rome.

And I mean this suffering Messiah was even a hard thing for the apostles to digest.

It was even for Peter.

Because in Matthew 16, Jesus tells Peter that Jesus himself must go to the cross.

Peter protests it, but then is immediately rebuked by Jesus.

And it's amazing that Peter now is proclaiming this truth of Jesus being a suffering servant to the Jews, which is actually carried out unknowingly by them, but was always part of God's predetermined plan.

But now neither their ignorant actions nor God's predictions could exonerate them.

They must repent and turn to God.

Peter is echoing his call from his first sermon at Pentecost.

Because after being cut to the heart, the people ask him what they must do.

And he says, repent.

He doesn't even wait for their question here.

He says, repent.

These are even the first words of Jesus's ministry.

Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

But now notice what Peter does not say.

A more modern message may sound something like this, where they would say that these people didn't know.

They didn't know what they were doing, but isn't it nice that God loves them anyway?

Because the concern today just starts and ends with forgiveness.

Repentance has become an afterthought.

There have even been some who say that repentance can come later.

They urge you to make the decision to follow Christ now, but then say repentance will follow later.

But this is the exact opposite of what we see in Peter's sermon.

We are not to get people interested in religion anyhow, somehow.

We have to follow the apostolic pattern.

Repentance is the first step after hearing the gospel.

But now what is repentance?

So our English word repentance comes from a Latin word meaning to think again, which corresponds to a Greek word meaning to change your mind.

And so firstly, the act of repentance will start in your intellect.

It will start in your mind.

However, it doesn't just include the intellect.

Because many today may say they believe in the gospel or that they know it to be true, but then they still carry out a life that shows the contrary.

That is just mere believism.

It is not true repentance.

Because in light of this wonderful miracle and revelation of the power of God, Peter is calling them to think again.

And this is the first step of repentance to say that I'm ready to think again about this message.

And now more specifically, what are we to think again about?

The first thing is God.

You have to think again about God.

The Jews themselves believed in God, but they had an incorrect understanding about Him.

They needed to think again.

The Pharisees were even teachers of God, but they had to think again.

Because now to merely say you believe in God is not enough.

I mean, who is your God or what is your God?

These Jews believe in a legalistic God.

They believe in a God that only had care for the self-righteous, but no concern for sinners.

Peter says, think again.

That isn't God.

And today, many say that God is solely and exclusively a God of love.

They don't believe in a God of the law or of righteousness or holiness.

They don't believe in a God that punishes sin.

They see the cross as only an act of love.

They claim that as Jesus was dying, He was saying, you have no idea what you're doing, but I love you anyway.

Because there's no punishment for sin.

There's no retribution.

There's no hell.

But this gospel tells them to think again.

Because who are we to say that God is only this or God is only that?

We must think again about God.

And secondly, repentance will cause you to think again about yourself.

Because we are all so self-satisfied by nature.

And John Calvin summarizes this perfectly when he says, He says, that man never attains to a true self-knowledge until he has previously contemplated the face of God and then come down after such contemplation to look into himself.

As for such is our innate pride, we always seem to ourselves just and upright and wise and holy until we are convinced by clear evidence of our injustice, our vileness and folly and impurity.

But convinced, however, we are not if we look only to ourselves and not to the Lord also.

He being the only standard of which this conviction can be produced.

And just to be, I mean, candid with you all, I mean, this is the hardest step for me.

I mean, I love theology.

I love learning more about just the wonderful doctrines of the Christian faith.

I enjoy thinking again about God, but I so often keep it at the intellectual level.

It's hard for the truths to flow down into my heart and allow them to change me.

And I honestly would argue that this is the hardest step for anyone.

It's uncomfortable and it hurts.

Because again, the call of repentance will always lead you to think again about yourself.

And I ask you, as you're thinking, ask yourself these questions.

Are you satisfied with yourself?

What is the value of your morality?

I mean, what is the value of your goodness?

What is the value of your righteousness in the sight of God?

I ask you to think again because there is something coming in the future and it's called death.

Are you ready for it?

Are you ready to face it and leave this world?

Do you stand before God with all of your righteousness behind you, how well you love your family, with how well you did at work, or how much you were in the Bible, and then expect to hear, well done, good and faithful servant?

Or can you be able to point with nothing behind you but point to Christ and say, this is the only reason I can stand here?

I know that many of these questions I've been asking are difficult.

However, there isn't been one question I've asked of you that I haven't already asked myself, that I haven't already asked the elders.

But this is a beautiful paradox of preaching, is that not only do I get to proclaim the Word of God, but I, or any pastor that gets up here, is equally in desperate need of it.

Because now as you think again about God and yourself, I urge you to think again about Jesus Christ.

Because can he be fully explained as a man or a prophet or a teacher?

Because Paul is a great example of the grace and love and the power of Jesus Christ.

Because a murderer and a persecutor was changed and used to be one of the greatest men in all of history.

And no matter what you've thought of Jesus throughout your life, how much you may have dismissed him, he's ready to do with you what he did to Paul.

Think again about Jesus.

Look up to him and take confidence that he says in John 6, 37, All who come to me, I will never cast out.

Because as you're thinking about Jesus, think about his death on the cross.

Because Jesus' death is just merely the death of a pacifist.

Can't you see there was a transaction that happened on the cross?

God made him to be our sins.

He laid all of our iniquities on him.

Now don't look to the cross as only a symbol of love.

The cross is a symbol of all of God's attributes in perfect unity.

Look to the cross and see his holiness and his just wrath upon sin.

Look to the cross and see his grace and his love by being our substitute, by taking on that wrath on himself.

And look to the cross and see his power and his glory that is proved by his resurrection and ascension.

But finally, not for you to think again, you are to change your mind.

Which means admitting that you are wrong.

Admitting that you are utterly and totally mistaken.

And this can't happen unless you feel what the Bible calls godly sorrow.

Because as you think about God, as you think again about yourself, as you think again about Christ, you will then see how arrogant you have been.

But again, it doesn't just affect the intellect.

Because once our mind grasps these truths, the heart will respond.

You will say about your sins, how could I have ever been capable of that?

Or how could I have ever done that to God?

And this is a very vital part of repentance.

To have your heart broken and feel contempt of your arrogance.

To see your morality and righteousness, as Paul says, as dung and rubbish compared to the value of knowing Jesus Christ.

But then why go through all of this?

Like what does repentance bring about?

Verses 18 to 21 says, Repent therefore and turn back that your sins may be blotted out.

That times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.

And that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all things.

God promises to blot out our sins.

To wipe our slate clean.

And to make us fully forgiven.

But luckily it doesn't just stop there.

Because what's the point of having our slate clean if we're still sinful and we'll get it dirty again?

He promises times of refreshing.

He promises to give us his spirit so as we face the world, as we still face the temptation of sin, as we are impacted by the sins of others, we can be refreshed.

We can be strengthened with a foretaste of the glory that will come once Christ returns.

Not only can we be free from the debt of our sin, but we can stand before God because Christ's righteousness has been given to us.

And true repentance will also display fruit.

As Acts 3, 26 says, God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness.

Because again, true repentance not only affects your intellect, it affects your mind or your heart and your will.

It causes you to hate and deny ungodliness and worldly lusts.

You will turn away from your wickedness.

You will become a new creation.

And I'm sure many, if not all of you, have heard this gospel many times.

But has it ever done anything to you?

Has it had any effect on you?

You may say you like listening to preaching, but has your listening to preaching done anything to you?

So my dear friends, if you cannot say that the person you are today is because of this message, this gospel, then you are not a Christian.

You may be in a church, but you will not be in the kingdom of God.

I urge you to take heed of this message, to think again about God's glory, his holiness, his goodness, and let it lead you to see your sins.

See that your own righteousness is nothing but filthy rags, and let it allow you to see the power and wonder of Jesus Christ.

Let it lead you to change your mind, to repent so that your sins may be blotted out, and you can be reconciled to God.

And Peter doesn't call these people to repent because of some power they have within themselves.

He didn't say to the paralytic, rise up and walk, because he had some hidden strength within him.

And it didn't have anything to do either with the urgency of Peter's message.

He called them to repent.

I call you to repent because the gospel is the mysterious engine by which God converts the hearts of men.

Because it is only by the power and the name of Jesus Christ can we be saved.

It is by faith in his name that will heal us from our paralyzed condition, to create strength in us to stand, to begin to walk and work in service to God, and leap in joy.

Praise in his name.

Just now, as I close, I just want to touch on one point that I believe is often missed when we preach about the gospel and repentance.

By becoming a new creation, we are free from the power of sin.

We have been healed.

By Jesus' death and resurrection, we are free from the penalty of sin.

But since he has not yet returned, we are not yet free from the presence of sin.

And this is why it's so crucial that non-believers and believers alike need to be told and reminded of the gospel.

It's so easy to forget the basics or the origins of our faith when life gets crazy, or we want to dive into a more difficult doctrine, or just when we've heard it for the thousandth time.

And Martin Luther said, I need the gospel every day because I sin every day.

The gospel is the sledgehammer that will break down our pride.

It's the sword that cuts and convicts our hearts.

But most of all, it's the very word of God that brings life and refreshment to our souls.

I just continue to be reminded of how glorious the gospel is, so that we may go and tell others about its wonder whether they are Christians or not.

Let me pray.

Holy and righteous Father, we thank you for the time that we get to spend hearing in your word today.

We're thankful that we are not alone, either in our sinful state, in our hopeless state, but not alone in having to figure it out.

We thank you for your word and how it restores our souls.

It heals us of our paralysis and brings only glory to you.

Allow us throughout this week and hopefully throughout our lives to continue to think again about you, to think again about ourselves in comparison to you, and to think again about the glory and the wonder of Jesus' death and resurrection.

Allow us not to take for granted that we get to do this without persecution at the moment, but we thank you that you are in control of building your church.

Just thank you again for giving us this word that we can be able to come here every Sunday, be able to hear it with all of our fellow saved sinners around us, and then be able to take it home and continue to study and ponder throughout the week.

Just thank you for the conviction, but also thank you for the refreshment that you bring.

We love you, and we cherish you, and we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ.

Amen.
