## Transcription

Five podcast listeners in the dark, but you five matter.

Fives and tens.

So manuscripts are just copies of the original text and letters.

For example, when we look at a lot all of the writings of the New Testament, right, whether it's written by John or James or Peter or Paul, they would write to a region, they would write to a specific church, they would write to a specific community, and what would happen is that community would then get their letter and they would pass it around, and as they're passing it around they're taking copies of the letter.

So when Paul writes to the Romans, to the church in Rome, and he has the amazing book of Romans, that then gets, they read it and then they're like we need to pass this to our friends, and so it gets written down and copied and copied and copied and copied and copied and copied and so when it says the earliest manuscripts do not include this set of verses, it's because they didn't.

So the question to ask specifically about this passage is when are the earliest manuscripts found, right, because it says the earliest manuscripts do not contain these texts that we're about to read.

So when are the specific, when is the earliest manuscripts found?

Well the earliest one of the book of John is, was actually found, it's a fragment of the book of John that is believed to be dated back to 100 to 150 AD and it's called the Riland fragment.

There it is right there.

So this is actually the front and then this is the back and this little fragment is current, it's in England actually right now and it's currently not on display because it's so old, again we don't have to get into that how do they date all these back but science is how they do it, and so anyways what you're looking at here is, so it's about a 9 by 6 centimeter, that little fragment is there, so very very small and it contains part of John 1833 which is on our, if you're looking at it the right side and then this is the left side, which is the flip side of that which contains part of John 1837 through 38 and so that's the absolute earliest fragment that we have of the book of John and again it's dated all the way back to 100 AD to about 150 AD and so yeah I just thought that was kind of cool you might want to see that if you care about those things, if not you can take it off the screen and so these verses in question that we're looking at today show up in the fourth century and in the past that would trouble me, I would go we don't like we don't have these texts like we don't have like what's wrong, we don't have the full text of a letter that was written over like why why is that but when you start to look at the incredible amounts of manuscripts and copies that we do have actually the opposite logic should apply we have such great evidence of earlier copies from the second and third century that this this group of verses showing up in the fourth century we can almost be assured that it was added later and for example we have of all the New Testament there are over 5,000 manuscripts so 5,000 copies of all of the New Testament and for works by like Homer and Plato from around the same time we have maybe five to about 200 copies of those of those writings and so when we think about the because again as it's being copied that's validifying the message and again we're you know even in this text that we're about to look at it it's very specific on on certain things it's very specific about certain places when we look at you know even the the book of John like when earlier talking about the man who was killed at the pools in Bethsaida and it talks about how there were these five colonnades these are descriptions that the people who were around at those times if they would if they would have been to the temple they would know okay there are these five colonnades there if it's like they went to a Burger King obviously it's written way way way later because anyways we don't need to go down this whole rabbit trail of the historical accuracy of scriptures I brought up the Plato and Homer argument is that if we if we as in a general society and culture believe this to be true with this amount of copies with this amount of textual evidence and we do not believe the scriptures to be true when it stomps on the amount of copies and historical accuracy of the text then we're living in a there's some hypocrisy there anyways okay this then leads us to another question there is variance there is differences and errors in copies of course having a perfect copy would be almost impossible but when we look at the majority of errors the errors in these copies of text are usual punctual and spelling but in the copies of scripture we do have there is no there are no errors in major doctrine of who Jesus was or major errors in doctrine that we hold true as the Christian Church today so the meat and potatoes of scripture from all these copies is the same there are little to no errors in major Christian doctrine which is great which then leads to the most important question for today so why teach on it why are you why am I about to teach on these verses that we're about to read the best manuscripts from history do not include this story in the John however the overwhelming consensus of textual critics people who go and are looking at the text people who are studying the text looking at the manuscripts is that this text was not part of the original gospel of John at least not this portion at this chunk in John at the same time the consensus is that this count is authentic it's apostolic and it should be contained in any edition of the New Testament well there belongs here as we're about to read in John chapter 8 which if we were to step back and read in its entirety and read it kind of the flow from chapter 7 all the way through verse 8 it kind of makes sense where it's placed it also some manuscripts actually have this portion in the gospel of Luke so it could be there which is where some manuscripts have it or somewhere else is a question that we will have answered on the other side of eternity but I believe this is the Word of God and so we're gonna dive into it this morning if I lost you the Bible is true and trustworthy and is the Word of God amen let's jump into John chapter 8 verse 1 we'll just read are the text we're going over today John 8 verses 1 through 11 if somebody wants to read that for us this morning John 8 1 through 11 early in the morning he came again to the temple all the people came to him he sat down and taught them scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery placing her in the midst they said to him teacher this woman has been caught in the act of adultery now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such a woman so what do you say this they said to test him that they might have some charge to bring against him Jesus bent down and wrote with his fingers on the ground and as they continued to him to ask him he stood up and said to them let him let him let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her and once more he bent down and wrote on the ground but when they heard it they went away one by one beginning with the older ones and Jesus was left alone the woman standing before him Jesus stood up and said to her where are they has no one condemned you if you said no one Lord and you said either do I condemn you go and from now on send them more awesome all right so verse 2 early in the morning he came again to the temple and all the people came to him and he sat down and taught them the scribes and the Pharisees so here we see kind of our main some of our main characters in the story we have the scribes and the Pharisees the scribes were Old Testament theologians they were law years that being experts in the law of Moses so they were lawyers get it then Pharisees which usually I say here they were the religious elite of the time which is true but for the sake of the text since they are completely a main character here in the story we're gonna dive a little bit further so the Pharisees were a party or a movement of conservative religious practice the term Pharisee literally means separated ones so they were living in a time where Jews were running away from the law and rejecting the law and so in protest to this there became a group of people who devoted themselves to following the law of Moses and they called themselves the separated ones or the Pharisees and the Pharisees were committed to spiritual moral and theological reform honestly kind of sounds about like us we live in a world that is completely run away from the things and the ways of God it's fallen away from the truth but we as Christians we as believers are trying our best to cling on to truth and to live out the truth and so that's the scribes and the Pharisees and some of us The scribes and Pharisees verse 3 brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and placing her in the midst they said to him teacher this woman has been caught in the act of adultery now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such woman so what do you say the law of Moses did in fact have laws on the books for adultery the penalty involving adultery involving sorry both a married person so a married couple there was adultery the penalty for the adulterer and the mistress or the other person was death that was their penalty but not specifically stoning however Jewish law specified if a man or woman was engaged but not yet married and if either was unfaithful with another person that was also considered adultery but that specific punishment was stoning so maybe this is a minor detail that the scribes and the Pharisees are giving us telling us that this woman was engaged whether she was the person to be whether she was betrothed the person to be married or not we don't get that detail but at any rate my first question to this is if she was caught in the act of adultery where's the other person says she's caught in the act it takes two to tango had the man had he run away from the mob of scribes and Pharisees did they just want to single out and take advantage of this woman well obviously we're in speculation was maybe the person who was cheating was it a scribe was it a Pharisee we don't I this is speculation we don't we don't get this we don't have an answer to any question but I think asking that question it does give us a little more clarity on the agenda of the scribes and the Pharisees and that agenda gets clearer and clearer as we read down to verse 6 this they said to him bless you that they might have some charge to bring against him him being Jesus so they bring this girl to Jesus and then they throw the law of Moses at Jesus to try it to try and get him a real gotcha moment but what they didn't realize was that they were messing with the true OG so let's remember Israel is under Roman occupation so the Romans allowed nations to sort of govern themselves and to rule themselves but they did not allow these nations to exercise the death penalty if someone was to be put to it to death for a crime that had to go through Rome that had to it had to go through the Roman judicial system and that is why Jesus is crucified under Pontius Pilate because Pontius Pilate was a Roman governor okay so the scribes and Pharisees laid out truthfully quite a doozy here for Jesus if this woman is guilty of the death penalty then Jesus is undercutting Roman authority and then the Pharisees can go to Rome with Jesus and say this person is trying to overthrow your authority right and then of course Jesus gets killed which is what they do to him anyways but that's besides the point if Jesus says she should not be stoned then Jesus denies the law and then the Pharisees and scribes could run to the Sanhedrin which were another were toward a sort of religious governing body if you will of the Jews and call him a heretic and then he would be in serious trouble so what does Jesus do as anyone else would do he bends down and writes with his finger on the ground okay fun fact this is the only mentioning of Jesus writing in the New Testament just a little for trivia later I'm just kidding now of course the question is what was Jesus writing the old preacher joke has it that Jesus knelt down to the ground and started writing all the names of the mistresses of the Pharisees Becky Lynn Sarah I'm Tammy you know I just others think he could have been writing Jeremiah 17 13 which says oh Lord the hope of Israel all who forsake you shall be put to shame those who turn away from you shall be written in the earth for they have forsaken the Lord then others just think that he could have been doodling thinking of what to say obviously we don't know we get to heaven and we can turn on heaven flicks and we can go to this account we could see what Jesus was actually writing but Jesus in all of his wisdom says verse 7 let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her and once more he bent down and wrote on the ground but when they heard it they went away one by one beginning with the older ones and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him when Jesus said let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her Jesus was speaking to the hypocrisy of the Pharisees they did not care about this woman quite frankly they didn't even care about her sin they wanted to trap Jesus and they were using this woman and her sin to prove a point and so Jesus seeing right through them says if you are without sin then lead the charge throw the first stone which actually is a callback to Old Testament law which said if you find someone in sin then you are to bring up the charge against them and so Jesus go they throw the law at Jesus and Jesus dishes it right back but remember the Pharisees were trying to trap Jesus in between Roman and Jewish law well Jesus ends up siding with Moses the woman was guilty of sin and she was guilty of stoning but Jesus examining the prosecutors and he found them unfit to bring the charges but Jesus the only man who falls into the category of being without sin did not throw the stone Jesus says to her woman where are they has no one condemned you she said no one Lord and Jesus said neither do I condemn you go and from now on sin no more notice here she calls Jesus Lord and in the Greek the word for Lord it has a few different meanings the sort of average standard meaning for Lord would be like sir so she could be saying no sir no one condemns me or within this miraculous moment Jesus within this miraculous moment through the grace of God on display through Jesus she could have come to faith right there and declared Jesus as her eternal Lord and Jesus says to her neither do I condemn you and from on sin no more I'm not sure the response she was thinking Jesus would give her but it probably wasn't the one that she got I'm reminded of John 3 17 for God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him there are sort of three main characters in the story we get Jesus scribes Pharisees I'm linking into one since they were up at it together and then the woman caught in adultery of the three you are to one of two of them we're clearly not Jesus and so we are either the woman in adultery or the Pharisees the Pharisees are unable to see the grace of God all they want to do is judge remember the Pharisees are set apart they are all about the law they are all about following the law of God perfectly what is one of the the the one of the things that the law was supposed to do was supposed to show us our need for a Savior it's supposed to show us how we fall short and the Pharisees are too busy measuring up other people that they don't see they fall short themselves all they wanted to do is judge and Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount he addresses this kind of behavior Matthew 7 verses 3 through 5 says why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye but do not notice the log that is in your own eye or how can you say to your brother let me take the speck out of your eye when there is the log in your own eye you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye chickadee check yourself before you wreck yourself it is so easy for us to look at others and judge and feel so high and mighty and we will get more into judgment next week but we must see the pride and the hypocrisy in the Pharisees which left them leaving this scene defeated what did they do they walked away one after another did that stop them from wanting to kill Jesus did God soften their hearts within that moment no they were so blinded by their own pride and their own hypocrisy and their own title that they could not see the Messiah standing in front of them and we must be careful of our pride because it can creep into judgment quicker than we'd like to admit the woman on the other hand yes she was guilty and yes we are all guilty there is no such thing as a good Christian if you can remember the story of the rich young ruler this young rich young ruler comes to Jesus and says good teacher what must I do to get into heaven and Jesus replies to him why do you call me good no one is good but God alone is Jesus saying that he's not good no is Jesus saying he's not God no he is just making the distinction that if you are a human if you are a regular human being if you are not Jesus God in a bod if that is not you then you are not good we love to think that we're good Christians and that's what I think that is the first that is the gateway drug into Pharisee ism very fair phariseeism that is the gateway drug into judgment is thinking you are good we are all flawed we are all broken and we are all in need of a Savior we are like this woman we are guilty we are ashamed we are naked and we are exposed but Jesus he clothes us with his righteousness which covers our guilt which covers our shame which covers our embarrassment which covers our nakedness and says neither do I condemn you why so we can go on sinning no Paul writes to the Romans in Romans 6 chapter verse 1 are we to continue in sin so that grace may abound no Jesus says go and sin no more he says be done with this life and go and forgiveness walk in grace if you are forgiven then we should repent what is repentance it is turning it is a 180 turn you are walking in sin you are walking in death you are walking in darkness and you turn the other direction and walk towards life walk towards light we must turn the other direction from our sinful ways and walk in the newness of life that Jesus has given us will we stumble will we fall yes but we get back up following Jesus knowing that he will sanctify us day by day I don't know this morning if you resonate more with the Pharisee or if you resonate more with the woman caught in adultery wherever you are may I suggest that you turn back to Jesus repent of our sin repent of our pride repent of us not following Jesus and turn back to him turn back to his love and see that he is not shaming us for doing wrong in fact that's why he came he did not come into the world to condemn the world but that we might have life through him but it's all turned to Jesus but it's all turned back to him let me pray for us this morning Jesus we thank you for who you are we thank you that in our sin in our shame in our guilt in our nakedness that you clothe us with your righteousness you cover us with your righteousness father whether we are full of pride this morning or whether we're feeling down and out maybe we see your love maybe we see your grace and maybe walk in freedom knowing that you give life you didn't come for perfect people you came for sinners and we are all sinners so Jesus we turn to you and we thank you it's in your name everyone said amen
