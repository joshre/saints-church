## Transcription

All right, so about 12 weeks ago, we started in this upper room discourse, unpacking this passage of scripture, which is really about three chapters.

It probably happened within a matter of hours, and we've spent months in it, and we're coming to a close of this upper room discourse.

And we spent the last few weeks looking at Jesus's high priestly prayer, as it's probably headed in your Bible.

And after this, Jesus is going to head out to the Garden of Gethsemane, where Judas will eventually betray him.

But before we get there, we have one more final unpacking of this, of Jesus's prayer.

And we're going to focus on the last paragraph of that prayer.

But for this morning, I would love if we could read the whole chapter of John 17, just to kind of remember where we've been, where we've been going.

And then we will jump into the last chapter and break it down together.

John 17, if somebody wants to read it aloud, and then we will zoom away.

When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour has come.

Glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you.

Since you have given him authority over all flesh, he gave eternal life to all whom you have given him.

And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.

I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work you gave me to do.

And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.

I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world.

Yours they were, and you have gave them to me, and they have kept your word.

Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you, for I have given them the words that you gave me.

And they have received them, and have come to know in truth that I came from you.

And they have believed that you sent me.

I am praying for them.

I am not praying for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.

All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.

And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you.

Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one.

While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me.

I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost, except the son of destruction, that the scripture might be fulfilled.

But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one.

They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

Sanctify them in the truth, your word is truth.

As you send me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.

And for the sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.

I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you.

That they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.

The glory that you have given me, I have given to them, that they may be one, even as we are one.

I in them, and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and love them, even as you love me.

Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me, because you love me before the foundation of the world.

O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me.

I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.

Awesome.

Thank you.

Okay, let's jump back up to verse 20 here.

It says, I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word.

As we've mentioned before, this prayer that Jesus prays, the chapter that we just read, is first and specifically for his disciples there in the room, right?

The 11 there, there's one missing, the son of destruction, as Jesus called him, to fulfill prophecy.

We saw that last week as we looked at Psalm of some chapter and some verse.

And so this was first meant for the 11 disciples there in that room.

But now in verse 20, Jesus includes all those who would believe in me through their word.

You might have heard this before, but if not, faith comes by hearing.

Faith comes through hearing.

Faith comes by hearing.

Faith, or faith comes by hearing.

Hearing what?

Hearing the words of the apostles.

As we mentioned last week, Jesus embodied, or he revealed, he revealed, sorry I lost my spot.

I forgot what I was saying.

Oh yeah, Jesus revealed the character of God in human flesh.

And we have these stories that are written down by the apostles in the gospels.

And then, of course, we have Acts, all of the things, all the acts, all the actions that the early church did.

And then all these letters that Paul has written along the way.

Of course, we're not discounting the Old Testament.

I'm just speaking here of what Jesus is talking about and moving forward.

Because, as Jesus mentioned even a few verses earlier, things happened in Jesus' time to fulfill the Old Testament, to fulfill Old Testament scriptures.

We preach and teach out of both the Old and the New Testament.

We love all of the Bible.

But when Jesus is talking about here, he's talking about through the word of the apostles, through the word of the disciples.

The apostles would be the eleven in that room, and then we'll add Paul here.

Jesus will add Paul later in Acts.

But, yes, our New Testament.

And if faith comes by hearing, like, first off, we just need to take a moment and appreciate and kind of marvel at the Spirit's keeping of this message.

The Spirit's keeping of this word that we have been given, that we have the pleasure not just to read in a paper Bible, but we could pull it out on our phones.

We can, you know, ask Siri to bring up Bible verses.

We could do crazy things now with technology, and we can see the scriptures everywhere.

And what a gift from God that he would give us his word, that he would share, that the Father would share the words to the Son, that the Son would share the words to the disciples, that the disciples, and then their disciples, and then their disciples, and then their disciples, and then their disciples, and so on and so forth until we get to all the way, us, here, now.

And these written down, these orderly accounts, right?

Like, these aren't just kind of, like, whipped together stories.

They were written to specific audiences for specific people at specific times and proving different parts of the revealed character of God through Jesus.

And so these scriptures that we have are debunkable, if you will, and they're beautiful, and the faith that we have came by hearing.

And the question I have for you is, if we have these words, if you're hearing these words now, but the question is, are you reading the words of the scriptures?

Are you reading the words of the scriptures?

And also that if faith comes by hearing, then are you reading these words to your children?

Are you reading these words to your children?

And you might be asking, he's already bringing up family church?

Yeah, I'm already bringing it up.

I'll bring it up later again, too.

You're going to get quite tired of me talking about family church.

But, again, I'm convinced and convicted that it is the number one disciple-making tool for families.

It's not a Sunday program.

It's not a midweek program, sending your kid to youth group.

It's not even VBS.

All those things are awesome, and all those things are great.

But faith comes by hearing, and the place that our children should be hearing the scriptures first and foremost and most consistently is not at a place where we gather on Sunday, but in a church or in your family on Monday.

Okay.

Verse 20, 21 says, Is Jesus' prayer for unity here, because it's going to continue on through these next few verses.

Is he talking about denominational unity?

Is he talking about, like, the individual churches that gather on a Sunday where they all need to be united and be under one banner and flag of the church?

I don't think that's what Jesus is getting at here.

I don't think that's what he's praying for.

I think if we were to look at the context of what he's prayed earlier in this chapter, what he even continues to pray in these verses, I think the unity that Jesus is looking for and the unity that Jesus is praying for is the same unity that we see with the Father and the Son.

And we'll get into more of this later.

But this prayer of unity, of being of the same mission, of being of the same, of doing the same things, a oneness in goal, a oneness in, of course, I think about sports, right?

Like, we can look at a football field, a soccer team, there's different positions, there's different people, but they're all trying to do one thing.

If you're on defense, you're trying to stop the other team from scoring.

If you're on offense, you're trying to score.

They're of one mission, of one mind, to win.

That's the point of a team, and a team united wins championships.

A team that is focused and lays it all out on the line for each other wins games, wins championships.

And that's what we see from the Father.

We're going to, we'll get there later, but earlier in John, Jesus tells us that he saw everything that the Father was doing.

Everything that God the Father was doing, the Son saw.

The Son knew the mission.

The Son knew the game plan.

The Son knew what was going to happen.

And so he knew what it looked like to win.

He knew what it looked like for him to win on earth.

And Jesus went to earth to fulfill that mission.

And Jesus is praying here a oneness of unity, of mission, of a gospel-spreading mission.

The other day, Kayla and I, we were in an Uber.

And we got in the car, and the guy, he had a pocket New Testament sitting on his dash.

And we, like, looked at each other, like, texted each other, like, oh, he's got a Bible.

He's got a Bible.

And it was, like, it was, it was, like, such a de-escalating thing.

You never know when you get into an Uber what you're going to find.

You never know what you're going to find.

And so we get into this Uber, and we meet this guy, and we ended up having such a lovely conversation with Ryan from Jamaica.

And, but we saw the, we, we even just seeing the scriptures, it was like, cool, we're on the same team.

We're, we're, we're on the same mission.

And, um, anyways, Jesus continues to talk about this oneness of, of mission.

And he says, the glory that you have given me, I have given to them, that they may be one, even as we are one.

I in them, and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them, even as you love me.

See, there it is right there.

What's the whole purpose of this unity?

That they may become perfectly one, so that, oh, whoops, I underlined the wrong line.

So that they, so that the world may know you, that you sent me.

That's the whole purpose.

So that the world may know that you sent me.

And we've mentioned this before, but it's worth mentioning now, as we're looking at this scripture, when, uh, in, in this context, when Jesus is using this word, world, that's referring to those who don't believe yet.

Those are non-believers.

Also, at the top of this verse, the glory that you have given me, Jesus says, the glory that you have given me.

And glory, that word commonly refers to the manifestation of God's character, or the revealing of God's character.

So, Jesus has shown the glory of God, he revealed the character of God, and he showed it first to his disciples, personally, to his first followers, and through them, to those who will believe on account of their message, right?

And he has done all of this, so that they may be one, even as we are one.

Jesus did all this, not just for his first followers, but the expectation was, that through the power of the spirit, that it would, there would be a ripple effect, there would be this sort of chain reaction of faith and sharing of the good news.

Right?

The glory that you have given me, so it started with God, the Father, giving it to the Son.

And what does he do?

I have given to them.

So, we see this sort of passing of the baton.

I have given it to them, that they may be one, even as we are one.

I in them, and you in me, that they may become perfectly one.

So that, right, we finally get to the action here.

Why?

So that the world may know that you have sent me.

So, we get this chain reaction.

It goes from the Father, to the Son, to, of course, his first disciples, and so on and so on.

Why are you highlighting that?

So on and so on.

And the question I have for you and for me this morning is, have you stopped that chain reaction?

Have you stopped that chain reaction?

Verse 24, Jesus continues.

Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am to see my glory that you have given me, because you love me before the foundation of the world.

The thing that sticks out for me in this text, in this scripture, is one day, you will see Jesus.

One day, you will see Jesus.

Like, just think about that for a minute.

One day, you will see Jesus.

I know you're like, yeah, no, duh.

Like, I hope so.

That's like the whole, yeah, I want to be with him.

But like, we've put our faith in this guy that we've never met, we've never seen, might have experienced, might have felt something, whatever that means.

But, we dedicate our whole lives around this man, this character, this Jesus person who was a real human.

Yet, we've never seen him.

And one day, we will.

One day, you will see Jesus.

Jesus.

And this is not like a hellfire and brimstone.

Like, if you don't believe in Jesus, you're going to hell.

Like, that's not what this point is about.

Although, yes, there is truth in that.

But one day, we will see Jesus in all of his glory.

In all of his glory, we will see Jesus.

And that just blows my mind.

Verse 25.

Oh, righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me.

I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.

Jesus said, I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.

And the question I have for us this morning is, how did the Father love the Son?

If that's the love that Jesus prays would be in us, right?

He says, at the end of 26 here, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them.

Then, it seems like a good question to ask would be, how did the Father love the Son?

How did the Father love the Son?

And, uh, all we have to do is go back up a couple verses to see, with an eternal love. 1724.

You loved me before the foundation of the world.

There was this eternal love, how the Father loved the Son.

Before the foundation of the world.

Before the Father spoke, and said, let there be light, the Father loved the Son.

Before the angel Gabriel was sent to have a coffee meeting with Mary, and tell her that she's going to be pregnant, the Father already loved the Son.

There is this eternal love between the Father and the Son.

An eternal love.

There's also, how else did the Father love the Son?

By giving Him all things.

John 3, 35 says, The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.

The Father does not hold back from the Son, but gives Him the full measure of His inheritance.

There was no, there's nothing withheld from the love of the Father.

There's nothing withheld from the love of God the Father to the Son.

But He's given Him, but He's given Him all things.

It's like the prodigal son, but good, instead of bad.

God is inheritance, and He multiplied it.

He's given Him all things.

The Father gave the Son all things.

How else did the Father love the Son?

This is a love through obedience.

John 10, 17.

For this reason, the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it up again.

Again, the Father loves the Son because of Jesus' obedience to Him.

And this passage, John 10, that we just mentioned here, this came, this is right around the passage of the Good Shepherd, where Jesus is talking about being a Good Shepherd, and how a Good Shepherd lays down His life for His flock, for His sheep.

Jesus lays down His life for His sheep.

But this isn't a cause and effect love, right?

This is a, like, a love because, so I love you, so I must obey you.

That's not, that's not what it is.

It's, no, I obey because I love you.

The Son willingly gives up His life.

I love this Augustine quote.

The Son did not begin to be loved when He began to obey.

Rather, obedience reveals the love already present.

Obedience reveals the love already present.

So we have this love through obedience.

And a love through revelation.

John 5, 20.

For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all that He Himself is doing.

You might have heard the phrase before, clarity is kindness.

I don't know if you've heard that phrase before.

Clarity is kindness, but it's a good one.

Clarity is kindness.

And that is this idea here.

The Father loves the Son by revealing to Him all that He was and is supposed to do.

And so Jesus knew exactly what to do because the Father showed Him what to do.

It's not like the Father gave Jesus an Ikea furniture box without the instructions.

Jesus had the instructions.

He knew exactly what to do.

He knew exactly what to do.

Shows Him all that He Himself is doing.

And lastly, how else did the Father love the Son?

Through a love shared.

Through a love shared.

John 15, 9.

As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.

Abide in my love.

We've already mentioned this chain reaction of love, but that's what it is.

It's a, the Father loved the Son.

The Son loved the disciples and so on and so forth.

And Jesus shares this love with us and He embodied this love for us.

So how did the Father love the Son?

Through an eternal love.

By giving Him all things.

By this love through obedience.

This love through revelation and through a love shared.

So, if that's how the Father has loved the Son, what does that mean for us?

What does that mean for us?

We have this eternal love from the Father.

The Father loves you.

He will always love you.

Come on, Whitney Houston.

He can't stop loving you.

Michael Jackson.

I just can't stop loving you.

There's an eternal love from the Father.

For us.

The Father always loves you.

Will always love you.

Cannot stop loving you.

The Father has given Him all things.

This is like you're in a restaurant.

You see a lovely plate go by.

And you say, I'll have what He's having.

That is that is us with with Jesus.

Jesus earned it.

Jesus earned everything.

I'll have what He's having.

Jesus earned eternal life.

I'll have what He's having.

Jesus has peace with the Father.

I'll have what He's having.

Jesus is the righteousness of God.

I'll have what He's having.

You see, when we put our faith in God, that's what it is.

I'll have what He's having.

Everything that Jesus has earned and I'll take it.

I'll have what He's having.

He has given God has given us all of those things.

He's given us eternal life.

He's given us peace with Himself.

He's given us righteousness.

He's given us His Spirit because He gave the Son all things.

He's given it to us.

But not only that, He provides for us.

He's given us all things.

Give us this day our daily bread.

He does that for us.

So there is an eternal, a salvific, if you will, a salvation based giving that we get from the Father.

And then there's also a daily grace and mercy from the Father and provision from the Father that He's given us. and then we get this love through obedience.

And I'm actually, I'm going to bounce back up here to this, to this one right here so we can see that quote again because I think this, this really helps, this really helps me kind of get, understand this a little better.

The Son did not begin to be loved when He began to obey.

Rather, obedience reveals the love already present.

If my obedience reveals the love already present, then, then the question that I think it will be helpful for us, the question is not, okay, where am I, where am I not obedient?

Not that question.

Not that question.

Because, truthfully, I think that's a question from the Pharisees.

That's a question the Pharisees would ask.

And Jesus rebukes the Pharisees.

He says, you know, why are you, you whitewash tombs, you're like a, you're like a cup where you just clean the outside.

But you don't worry about what's on the inside.

And when we just ask, when we think about this love through obedience and we just ask, okay, where in my life am I not obedient?

That, I think, can, is washing the outside of the cup.

The question I want to ask is, why am I not obedient?

Why?

Why?

What's, what's going on on the inside?

Why is this, why is this hard hard for me?

Why is it hard for me after a long day at work and I get home and I just want to sit and veg and I don't want to put in the time with my spouse, with my kids?

Why?

What's, what's going, what's going on inside?

Why is it a struggle for me to, you know, we talk about this family church thing, we talk about having a time of prayer, of going over the catechism, of opening up a Bible together as a family and even singing together.

Why is that such a hard thing for me to do?

Why does that feel so intimidating?

Why is that, why?

Why is it so hard for me to serve those who are different than me?

Why, why does this co-worker who always does this one thing, why does that, why does that bother me?

Why do I have a, why do I have a hard time giving of my time and talents and the money that God's given me?

Why do I, why do I hold back?

Why?

Why am I not being obedient?

I think when we start to ask that question, why?

We start to wrestle and we start to kind of understand kind of the love that's already present. and we can really start to challenge our our pride because I mean, truthfully, I think that's what it all comes down to.

One way or another, it's probably pride.

I'm too prideful to do this.

I can't do this.

Or maybe it's a false sense of humility.

You're actually thinking of, you're thinking less of yourself rather than thinking of yourself less.

You're thinking of, I can't do that.

I'm not a pastor.

I don't have a degree.

I can't lead a devotional for my family.

I can't do that.

Well, actually, scripture says you can and you should.

So why am I not obedient?

That's loving through obedience.

Loving through revelation.

God gave us the plan.

He told us what to do.

Right?

He commissioned us, if you will.

Matthew 28, 19.

Go, therefore, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything that I commanded you, and behold, I am with you always to the end of the age.

God gave us the plan.

And go, he said.

Go.

Go.

Go.

Don't stay in your bubble.

Don't just stay with what's comfortable, but go.

Go, go, go.

And guess what else he promises?

When you go, I'm going to be with you.

I have an eternal love for you.

Go.

Go.

God gave us the plan.

Did he necessarily give us the exact words?

No.

Well, yeah, he did.

He gave us his word.

Did he give us situational words?

I don't know.

Maybe if you were so indrenched in the word, this word would start coming out in a moment of evangelism or talking with friends or. he gave us his word.

He revealed himself bodily and he gave us his word.

Then a love shared.

Jesus extends this love from the father to his people.

Again, this is that chain reaction.

Love from the father to the son, to the disciples.

And I'll include all disciples in this one so I don't have to make all the marks.

And I asked it earlier, but I'll ask it again.

Has the chain stopped with you?

Has the chain stopped with you?

Are you sharing the love that God has given you with others?

Not just with those who we know also sharing that love, but with the non-believers in our lives.

Are you sharing that love?

And again, this doesn't need to be super in your face.

Hey, you know, Jesus loves you.

Hey, you know, Jesus sometimes it does need to be in your face, but sometimes it's slow relational building, praying behind their back.

But has the chain stopped with you?

And if so, let's just go up a couple questions and ask.

Why?

Would you pray with me?

Jesus, we thank you for your word.

We thank you for the love that you showed to the Son.

We thank you, Father, for the love that you showed to the Son.

And we thank you that you have given us that same love.

Father, I pray as we go this morning and as we go throughout our day and our week, that Spirit, you would convict us.

Convict us as we ask why.

Why am I not doing this?

Why am I not doing that?

And help us get to the root of the issue.

We just don't want behavior modification. what we really want is for our hearts to love you more.

We really desire to love you more.

And so would you help us?

Would you lead us and guide us?

Because we cannot do it on our own.

We need your Spirit.

We thank you that you've given us your Spirit to sanctify us, to mold us and shape us into who you want us to be, not for ourselves, but for others.

Put people in our lives that we can share your love with and help us to be bold.

We thank you, Father. it's in your name.

Everyone said, Amen.
