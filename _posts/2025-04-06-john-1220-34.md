## Transcription

Alright, this morning we will turn to John chapter 12.

And we can just read our text this morning, John 12.

We'll read verse 20 through 34.

John 12, 20 through 34 if somebody wants to read that for us.

John 12, 20 through 34.

I'll read.

Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks.

So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.

Philip went and told Andrew.

Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.

And Jesus answered them, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.

Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone.

But if it dies, it bears much fruit.

Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.

If anyone serves me, he must follow me.

And where I am, there will be my servant also.

If anyone serves me, my Father will honor him.

Now my soul will struggle, and what shall I say?

Father, save me from this hour, but for this purpose I have come to this hour.

Father, glorify your name.

Then a voice came from heaven, I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.

The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered.

Others said an angel had spoken to him.

Jesus answered, This voice has come for your sake, not mine.

Now is the judgment of this world.

Now will the ruler of this world be cast out.

And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.

He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die.

So the crowd answered him, We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever.

How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up?

Who is the Son of Man?

So Jesus said to them, The light is among you for a little while longer.

Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you.

The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he was going.

While you have the light, believe in the light that you may become sons of light.

We don't get that back and forth.

We don't even know what kind of Greeks they are.

Are they God-fearing Gentiles?

Are they just, are they like Greek-speaking Jews?

We don't quite fully understand the context of who these Greeks are.

But if we were to look at Mark's Gospel or any other of the other Gospel accounts, we would see right after the triumphal entry, there is Jesus goes into the temple, he overturns the tables, and he makes that big skeptical spectacle there.

And he makes this scene about how the temple was not being used for its proper intent.

There was all this money changing, and there were all these different temple coins, and you need to exchange this coin for that coin, and really just was not, the temple was not being used how it was meant to be used.

And if you need a reminder of the temple, there was these outer courts, or could also be known as the Court of the Gentiles, then an inner court, which like only Jews were allowed into that court, and then the Holy of Holies, which of course only the high priests could go in once a year, and so there were these different spots.

And so maybe these Greeks saw Jesus' actions in the temple, as they were in the Court of the Gentiles, and they were out, they were in that court, and maybe that's what was going on here.

But obviously John didn't care too much to put it in there.

And so anyways, we carry on.

Some disciples, some of the disciples bring these Greeks to Jesus, and his response kind of seems like he's completely disregarding the Greeks.

He doesn't even mention like, bring the Greeks to me, or whatever he just says.

Verse 23, It bears much fruit.

So we see the sort of agrarian metaphors and parables throughout Jesus' words and throughout the Gospels.

And of course it was an agrarian society, that was just kind of what people did.

And I mean, I guess here in this room there's a few green thumbs.

And so you might understand the metaphor there a little better than others.

But we must note, Jesus says, Truly, truly I say to you, and we've seen that a time or two throughout the Gospel here of John.

And Jesus saying like, I tell you the truth, or like, take this to the bank, or like, this is a sure thing.

If I do not die, I remain, well he says, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone.

But if it dies, it bears much fruit.

And we could take that to say, Jesus is essentially saying like, If I do not die, I remain alone.

Is he talking about like, heaven?

Like, he remains alone in heaven if he does not die.

Could be, potentially.

If Jesus dies, he bears much fruit.

And to steal from Jesus' later words in verse 32, And when he dies, he will draw all people to himself.

Of course, when he's lifted up, talking about the cross, He dies, bears much fruit.

Like this grain of wheat that falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone.

But if it dies, it bears much fruit.

And so when he dies, Jesus dies, he will draw all people to himself.

Is he talking about literally every single person on earth?

Probably not.

He's most likely talking about the Jew and the Gentile, The Jew and in this circumstance, the Greek.

That is the bearing much fruit that Jesus is most likely referring to there.

And then let's take this back to the temple.

By Jesus dying, there is not just fruit for the Jew.

There are not these different courts.

There is not an outer court or the court of the Gentiles.

There is not this inner court and the holy of holies.

There, but this grain of wheat that falls and it dies, it bears much fruit.

That fruit breaks the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile.

Bringing the holy of holies into all people.

Bringing the presence of God into all people through the atonement of Jesus Christ.

Jesus continues to say, whoever loves his life, verse 25, loses it.

And whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.

If anyone serves me, he must follow me.

And where I am, there my servant be also.

If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.

So we get this sort of equation, right?

If you love your life, you lose it.

If you hate your life, you keep it.

Is Jesus saying we just need to like be like Eeyore throughout life?

Could be worse.

Not sure how, but it could be.

End of the road.

Nothing to do and no hope of things getting better.

Like that's not, that's not us hating life.

I don't think that's what Jesus is getting at here.

But to serve Jesus, you must follow Jesus.

To follow Jesus is not just following him in his miracles.

It's not just following him in turning water into wine.

Although that's pretty cool.

It's not just following him to a popular song, that song.

And I ran out of that grave.

It's not just running out of the grave.

If we follow Jesus, we must follow him to his death.

Death of self.

Death of our desires.

Paul will later write in Romans 8, verse 17.

And if children then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we also may be glorified with him.

To follow Jesus is to follow Jesus both in his death and also his resurrection.

Is to suffer and also that we may be glorified with him.

Then Jesus continues to say, verse 27, Now is my soul troubled.

And what shall I say?

Father, save me from this hour, but for this purpose I have come to this hour.

Jesus says, now is my soul troubled.

And that word troubled, originally in the Greek it could be translated as terrified.

Or horrified, or even the feeling with it is almost like anxious or agony.

Jesus is terrified.

He is horrified.

Think about that for a second.

Jesus is horrified.

Jesus is absolutely terrified.

I love we have that scripture in Hebrews that tells us of Jesus can empathize with us in our weakness.

Which is incredible to read, but to read in the gospel of Jesus' own words saying that he is troubled.

Or he is terrified.

He is in horror.

It just kind of, that's, whoa.

So Jesus says this, now is my soul troubled.

And what shall I say?

Father, save me from this hour, but for this purpose I have come to this hour.

So Jesus has expressed this terror that was within his soul.

And this next sort of sentence or phrases of sentences can either be read as a rhetorical question or a prayer.

And I think it's probably better read as a prayer than Jesus said, what shall I say?

Father, save me from this hour.

To me, given the context and what's going to happen after and even what's happened before, for it to be read as a question really kind of puts this weird kind of not, it doesn't seem very John like.

It doesn't seem like it would bring a weird, I think, dynamic of we see this constant throughout the book of John, this idea of the glory of Jesus fulfilling his father's commands, them being one.

And so to have this rhetorical question doesn't really fall in line with it.

But if it's embodied as a prayer, if this is Jesus praying to God, now is my soul troubled.

What shall I say?

Father, save me from this hour, but for this purpose I have come to this hour.

It feels very similar to the setting of the garden of Gethsemane where Jesus is praying and he's asking, Father, take this cup from me, but not my will be done, but yours be done.

Right?

We see that same sort of flow of what shall I say?

Father, save me from this hour, but for this purpose I have come.

It's almost this prayer, this Jesus remembering what he has come for, also realizing the wrath of God that was going to sit on him.

And he is obviously troubled.

And in this moment, it's like he says, and what shall I say?

And Father, save me from this hour, but for this purpose I have come to this hour.

When Jesus at the garden, right?

He says, Luke gives us the account of Jesus sweating what was like drops of blood at the garden of Gethsemane.

Father, is there any other way?

Take this cup from me, but not my will be done, your will be done.

It's almost like another rendition, a different time of Jesus being in agony.

Modern day science would tell us that there's this symptom of sometimes when people are in, I can't remember the exact name off the top of my head, but there's this symptom of when someone is in terrible anxiety, they can start sweating drops of blood.

So again, we see Jesus is thinking about this, obviously at the garden, he's a lot closer to it, and here he's a few days out, and he understands what is coming before him.

He understands his purpose, and he's troubled, he's anxious, he's horrified, and in this moment he says, and what shall I say?

Father, save me from this hour, but for this purpose I have come to this hour.

Jesus quickly reminds himself that this terror, this agony, this troubling is why he has come.

And the next words from Jesus are equally as important.

Verse 28, Father, glorify your name.

Jesus in this tense moment with himself, he's feeling troubled, terrified, horrified.

Father, save me from this hour, but for this purpose I have come for this hour.

And then he goes, Father, glorify your name.

Jesus's purpose is to glorify the Father, not glorify his name, but the Father.

Jesus will be glorified by what he is about to do, take up the cross, but the higher purpose of the cross was that the Father would be glorified by the satisfaction of his justice.

The justice of the Father will be glorified through the death of the Son, through the sacrifice of the Son.

When the Son paid the debt for the sin of the world, God would be glorified.

Think about that picture for a moment.

We like can understand it.

We kind of get it up here.

But think about the justice and judgment of God being so right, being so holy, being so perfect.

And it was so satisfied through the death of Jesus, his Son, that it glorified God.

I don't know if you've ever had a project that you've had to do around the house or something that you just really needed to get done.

And then you finally do it.

You complete it.

You sit back and you look at your work and you're like, ah, yes, that feels good.

That's that moment of satisfaction.

That's that moment of like, ah, cool.

Now I can move on with the next thing.

Or this thing is done.

I feel good about it now.

You can put it to rest.

Imagine that, but times a billion.

Thousands of years of God's people turning away from him.

Thousands of years of a covenant, of a promise of what was to come.

And that day is quickly approaching.

And Jesus does not want to glorify his name.

He wants to glorify his Father's name.

God would be so satisfied with the sacrifice of the Son.

God would become glorified with the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world.

When the Lamb would be slain.

So Jesus says, Father, glorify your name.

Then a voice came from heaven.

I have glorified it and I will glorify it again.

The Father's name has been glorified through Jesus.

We know this because Jesus has spoken to this through his ministry.

John 7, 18, the one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory.

But the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true and in him there is no falsehood.

The one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true and in him there is no falsehood.

John 8, 29, and he who sent me, these are yet again the words of Jesus, and he who sent me is with me.

He has not left me alone for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.

The Father's name has been glorified through the works of the Son.

And God the Father's name will continue to be glorified as Jesus will fulfill his purpose on the cross.

This is also another time that we see God address Jesus and Jesus will later tell us that it's not.

This wasn't for Jesus' sake, but of course we see his baptism.

This is my son whom I loved and loved in which I am well pleased.

And then John doesn't give us the account of the transfiguration, but we get that account where some of Jesus' disciples are around him and God audibly speaks and says, this is my son, follow him, believe him.

And we have this time with the Father saying, I have glorified it and I will glorify it again.

Verse 29, the crowd that stood there heard it and said it had thundered.

Others said an angel spoke to him.

Jesus answered, the voices come for your sake, not mine.

Jesus is recorded saying throughout the gospels, he who has ears, let him hear.

And here we see the crowd is split between what voice they hear.

Others think it's thunder, then some say an angel has spoken.

If Jesus is your Lord and Savior, congratulations, you have ears to hear.

But the question is, are you listening?

You see, you are saved.

You have ears to hear.

And the question is, are you listening?

In ancient Israel, hearing and doing were the same thing.

Not so much with us.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who has heard something and either flat out rejected what I was supposed to do or forgot what I was supposed to do.

That could be a nudge from the Spirit or maybe a nudge from my wife.

Regardless, I would ask you, what is getting in the way of you hearing Jesus?

You have the ability to, but the question is, what are you allowing to get in the way of hearing Jesus?

I've heard previous pastors call it static on the line.

Sometimes they're static on the line, which is like, obviously, I mean, sometimes calls just break up now, but it's usually not static on the line anymore these days.

Of course, he was a boomer pastor, but that's neither one nor the other.

Is it shame?

Is it guilt that's on the line?

Is it guilt that keeps you from following Jesus?

What's getting in the way of you hearing Jesus?

And of course, if God's going to speak to you, he's going to speak to you.

But sometimes we allow our shame, our guilt, fear of what's on the other side.

We don't want to let a person down because it goes against their wishes.

Sometimes we let these things get in the way of us being obedient to God.

What am I trying to say?

If you follow Jesus, you follow Jesus.

Are we going to get it perfect?

No.

I hope we understand that now and we grasp that.

I think sometimes we have this idea of like, oh, I just feel so distant from God.

That's not God.

That's us who's putting that distance there.

And usually what I found in my own personal life, I'll speak about myself.

Usually if that is the case, it's some sort of shame, it's some sort of guilt.

I'm just like Adam and Eve in the garden.

I just want to go and hide because I've realized I'm naked, because I've realized I'm exposed, because I've realized the weight of my sin.

And instead of running to the Father and asking for forgiveness, I go and hide.

I'll do this in my marriage.

I sin against Kayla and I go and hide.

I don't go and confess right away.

I don't make things right.

I go and I hide.

And I sit in my shame.

I sit in my guilt.

Instead of asking for forgiveness, instead of repairing the relationship.

That's on me.

That's not on a good and perfect God.

And so I need to understand that the things that I'm putting in the way of following Jesus, those are things that through the loving kindness of the Holy Spirit will get sanctified out of me.

But I think sometimes it's good for us to ask these questions and think about what are my tendencies?

What am I starting to do?

How am I reacting?

How am I responding to my sin?

How am I responding to my flesh?

If you follow Jesus, follow Jesus.

Count the cost.

We must count the cost of following Jesus.

We must understand that if people hated Jesus, they will hate us.

If you love your life, you lose it.

And that's not to say life can't be enjoyable here, that we can't have a great time here.

But we must understand that this is only part of it.

This is just the start of our lives.

If you love your life, you lose it.

If you hate your life, you keep it.

If you follow Jesus, follow Jesus.

Not just in His resurrection, not just in His miracles, but follow Him to His death.

So that in Him and through Him, you can experience new life and life abundantly.

And that's what we all want.

That's what we all desire.

And so what is getting in the way of that?

What in you?

What sin in you?

What family history in you?

What fleshly tendencies in you are getting in the way of that?

Pray and ask God to reveal those things to you, so that we can follow Jesus.

Dearly Father, I thank you for your Word.

We thank you for your example of you.

Doing the terrifying thing, doing the horrifying thing, doing the troubling thing.

Jesus, we know in our flesh we cannot do that.

But through your Spirit, you can give us your fruit.

You can empower us to do things that would surprise us.

Father, we know that we are broken individuals.

And we thank you so much for your Son and for His Gospel.

For His good news.

That we can rest in that finished work.

And know that you've given us your Spirit to empower us.

And to do things that we cannot understand.

We would respond in situations like we wouldn't understand.

Not because of our own strength, but because of your Spirit at work in us.

And so Jesus, would you reveal to us the places where our flesh needs to continually be surrendered to you.

Help us to trust you more.

Not trust in our works.

Spirit, would you sanctify us.

We thank you for your truth, Jesus, as it is thy truth.

Help us to live and walk in the freedom of your Word.

In the freedom that comes from following you and submitting to you.

Jesus, we thank you for your Word.

We thank you for your Spirit.

And it's in Jesus' name.

Amen.
