## Transcription

This morning to John chapter 4 and we're looking at John 4 verses 43 through 54 and for the sake of time we'll actually just read these verses and we'll skip the first part of John chapter 4.

The lovely story of the woman at the well and yeah so something I want to read John chapter 4 starting verse 43 through the end of the chapter.

And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill.

When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee he went to him and asked him to come down and heal the son for he was at the point of death.

So Jesus said to him unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.

The official said to him, sir come down before my child dies.

Jesus said to him, go your son will live.

The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way.

As he was going down his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering.

So he asked them the hour when he began to get better and they said to him yesterday at the seventh hour.

The fever left him.

The father knew that was the hour when Jesus said to him your son will live and he himself believed in all his household.

This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.

Awesome.

When you read that first paragraph there starting with verse 43.

And again I guess yeah re-rooting us in context.

John 4, the very beginning of this chapter, Jesus has that conversation with the woman at the well and then he she believes in him.

She goes back into the town and says I met this man who I think is the Messiah and then he come then the town comes out they hear Jesus and then they invite him into town and so then after two days he departed for Galilee.

So he stayed there in Samaria him and his disciples there for two days and they kept going northward toward Galilee, the Sea of Galilee and passed again he was coming from Jerusalem goes up through Samaria then is on his way to the Sea of Galilee which is still upward more and he gets there and we don't get the we get more context of verse 44 in the other Gospels but in John's Gospel he just gives us for Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown and so Nazareth again Jesus was born in Bethlehem and which is not in this area but he moved later to Nazareth and so when he says a prophet is without honor in his hometown he they're referring to Nazareth because Nazareth is in the north and so he has as John says as Jesus said he has no honor there but then it kind of gets confusing because so when he came to Galilee again which Galilee is the it's the region there all around the Sea of Galilee and so Nazareth would have been one of those towns and where I read Kena would have been one of those towns Capernaum again one of those towns in the Sea of Galilee region and he says verse 45 so when he came to Galilee the Galileans welcomed him well how does he not have how do they not honor him because it just said there's a prophet is without honor in his own hometown but then says the Galileans his regional people they welcomed him and then it makes sense if we just keep reading having seen that all he had done in Jerusalem so then that gives us a call back to chapter 2 right when Jesus was in Jerusalem and they saw what he did at Passover and I'll read chapter 2 verse 23 now when he Jesus was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing but Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them because he knew all people and needed no one to bear witness about man for he himself knew what was in man so when which kind of unlocks the answer for us at the very beginning or I guess at the very beginning of the past we're looking at today where they so they saw him in Jerusalem they some people some other Galileans were down there for Passover and they saw Jesus perform miracles they saw him do signs and wonders and so they knew of the power of Jesus and John all the way back in chapter 2 said but Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them because he knew all people and and needed no one to bear witness about man for Jesus knew and so John is already giving us the answer to this weird collection of sentences that again he departed for Galilee for Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown he already knew what was in man Jesus knew what it was in man so he knew that whether he was there physically or not he already knew what was in man and so he knew that they would not honor him but they would want something from him they would want his miracles they would want his his power because they saw him at the feast and they're like oh sweet Jesus in town now hey come over here man like come eat at my restaurant I'd love to hang out with you I come to my house come be with me so Jesus is doing miracles and signs and now when he come back they welcome him because oh do the trick do the trick do the one thing it reminds me of like when your kid is little and they're just like starting to do something cool and it's like oh look he can sit up look he can he can clap he can like shake something it's like wow look at this it's amazing look at this show pony and that's like how they're treating Jesus is like hey look he's here let's show us what you can do so which you contrast from Samaria where they believed on his word right like if we were to jump up a couple verses in chapter 4 it says that the the townspeople of Samaria they needed no the woman kept on saying look he told me all I ever did and the people said we don't we don't need to hear from you anymore we've we've heard him we've heard his word not his actions not his miracles but we heard him and now we know he is the Messiah so like we already have this contrast between Samarians which again to a Jew would have been trash would have been Georgia fans just absolute garbage a bunch of dogs good boy that's beside the point that's neither here nor there just trash and yet these people receive him just on his word not on his works and now he's going back to his own hometown going back to his own people his own kind his own region and he all they want to see are his miracles and not hear from the Messiah just I'm giving away the main point of the whole passage here but at least what we're what we're looking at today but it's a it's a warning it's a good warning and it's so nice we need to hear it twice okay verse 46 so he came again to get Cana in Galilee where he made the water wine and at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill so Jesus again is coming back from Cana where he turned water into wine and so I'm sure the the miracle that happened other than what they if they saw him in Jerusalem they saw that if not they heard about the wedding they heard about him telling these servants to fill up these washing jars and turned it into the finest of wine and I'm sure the people they were like can you believe like that was crazy and so word gets out and there's actually some funny enough there's some debate about this passage because it's very similar to if you're familiar it's a story found both in Matthew and Luke and it's it's very similar to this passage here but for whatever reason people like to clump them together and also say that this is one of the parts where the Bible is contradicts itself because there's a very similar story of a a centurion a Roman soldier who goes to Jesus and asks him to heal his servant and then Jesus heals a servant and yay amazing but the contrast of this story that I think clearly makes it a different story is that it's a an official which depending on which translation you're looking at it could either say royal official it could say a nobleman ours just says official if you're looking at the ESV it just says an official most believe it was a like someone who was in King Herod's crew again so just a regional sort of a regional manager a regional king has no real authority over well as authority over the Jews but no governing authority as far as Rome goes right they kind of put this man in place and say yeah just do your thing with all you Jews and most believe it would have been a an official of King Herod versus a centurion which would be again for Rome so two different stories I should just move past it but fun fact there you go if somebody ever comes up to you and says look this is a contradicting story they got it wrong it's like no it's just different story dude anyways verse 47 when the man heard that Jesus had come from Judah to Galilee he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death so Jesus said to him unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe a lot of us in here have young kids and so you might or if you don't have a young kid you have a young kid or you know of a young kid or you've just been at a point of desperation where you're just crying out for help but immediately I thought of it being 3 a.m. and a kid waking up sick and you've just tried everything and nothing works and you're just like why God why I just want to be asleep right like that's just an absolute desperation for someone you love who is sick not doing well it could look like a plethora of different things but here we see a story of a man who is dealt with a son who is sick and so sick that he is beyond the point of death and if this was a royal official then he would have had some sort of money he would have had some sort of of of understanding of of different doctors and had different people consult and he's just at the end of his rope and so now he hears of this guy named Jesus who he's heard stories about he's he's heard who's who's healed people who's turned water into wine who's who's done these different things who's upset even his own king and his own his own people for flipping over the tables at the temple and he could have had the best doctors the best treatment the best sort of education the best people the best medicine to heal a son and nothing works and he's desperate and so he makes about a 20 mile journey because he heard that Jesus was gonna be in Cana and he goes to Cana and which again 20 miles that's nothing but when you're walking it and we don't know the time of year to the cold or it's hot in the Middle East like it's not flat terrain it's probably some tough 20 miles that's almost a marathon I don't want to walk a marathon I don't want to run a marathon who knows maybe at a horse or a donkey or something but anyways we know from later in the text it at least took him two days because he had to stop somewhere unless he left really early in the morning and just made a whole long trek anyways so he travels quite a distance to meet this man who could potentially heal his son so he goes to Jesus and says will you come with me and heal my son and Jesus responses unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe the official responds sir come down before my child dies Jesus said to him go your son will live the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way I was reading a commentary and it was talking about the man to trust the word of Jesus which like yeah of course amazing for this man travel all that time travel all that ways to just in absolute desperation go to this healer go heal my son and Jesus rebukes him unless you see signs and wonders you won't believe and he goes come heal my son of course we don't have we can't hear the tone of voice we can't hear the desperation we can't hear these kinds of things but I imagine he's just so just like I I need I need my son to be healed and then Jesus says to him go your son will live and then the man believe the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way it's like okay cool plus you in business like to me this feels a whole lot more like a Facebook marketplace meetup then like like talking with the Messiah right like cool the price is 100 bucks here's 80 no okay here's a hundred thank you go on your way right like that's all we get but when I look at Jesus's first comment there in verse 48 unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe I think of the lack of faith from the Jewish people faith simply defined is believing without seeing right and faith involves placing complete trust and dependence on God and the Jewish people's belief was what on they could see not on what not on just the word again such a contrast from the Samaritans and the Jewish people and so Jesus heals the man son went on his way and yeah we're missing the tone and the desperation potentially of this man but we're also missing the tone of Jesus when he said go your son will live was it like go your son will live was it you know to look him in the eyes go your son will live was there like what kind of like confidence assurance we don't know that we can't see that we can't feel that but obviously he felt good enough that like cool I can leave as he was going down first 51 his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering so we asked them the hour when he began to get better and they said to him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him the father knew that that was the hour when Jesus had said to him your son will live so the official leaves Jesus and is heading home and he had to stop somewhere overnight because it implies the next day when he got there and so we don't know if his servants met him halfway if he actually got home and then talked to his talk to the servant but they explained to him how his son is getting better and it happened at the time when he met Jesus and what is this officials response to Jesus miracle and he himself believed in his household now there's one sort of thing I want I want to hit on as we close but before I make my point let's remind ourselves of the whole reason John is writing this gospel John 20 verse 30 and 31 now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that by believing you may have life in his name these signs are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and by believing you might have life in his name what happened from this man's encounter with Jesus sure his son was granted more life he was granted water that would make him thirst again recalling the conversation that Jesus had with the Samaritan woman but his him and his household they drank of the living water that eternal life of believing in Jesus the point of John writing this book is so that others would believe that Jesus is the Messiah that he is the Christ and the Savior of the world and we have the incredible perspective of thousands of years of history and tradition and science for us to see Jesus as Savior and as Lord and with that familiarity I believe can come complacency it can be so easy for us to embrace Jesus for his gifts rather than for us to worship him as God just in this chapter we see Jesus declaring that he is living water that he is what our souls long and thirst for he is what our hearts truly desire and then right after that we see a story of a guy going to Jesus for what he can do heal his sick son we know the man didn't believe in Jesus yet his belief came after the Sun but I must ask the question are you worshiping God for who he is or for what he can do for you is your worship of God for who he is or what he's done of course like I said we have the incredible ability of perspective so we can see all that God has done and know who he is and worship him in light of that but I think we would we would be lying to ourselves if that was always the case if we would remember who God is and worship who he is and yet oftentimes I can wish want or pray for him to fix a circumstance for him to fix a situation for him to work something out for my gain and my glory and not simply just to seek first his kingdom and all else will be added we have an all-powerful all-knowing ever-loving God and yet how many times do I just want him to fix something for me I miss the benefit of trusting and resting in who he is and his word because I'm more concerned about what he can do for me I am more captivated by the miracle and captivated simply just that there is a miracle worker that simply just that there is a Messiah so as we close I want to as David says in Psalm 23 your rod and your staff they comfort me let us take comfort and maybe some conviction even in the rod and staff of Jesus's word Matthew 6 25 therefore I tell you do not be anxious about your life what you will eat or what you will drink nor about your body what you will put on is not life more than food and the body more than clothing look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap or gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not more value than they and which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life and why are you anxious about clothing consider the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spin yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these but if God so clothes the grass of the field which is today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much more clothe you oh you of little faith therefore do not be anxious saying what shall we eat what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the Gentiles seek after these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them all but seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you let me pray for us Jesus we thank you for who you are we thank you for your love we thank you for your peace your patience your kindness your goodness your faithfulness your gentleness your self-control Jesus we thank you for your word this this book that you have given to us where we get to read of your power and your might when you walked this earth and father we thank you for having us be alive at this time and in this place where we could see all of your miracles that were written in in the Bible and know that one then they're not all the miracles but the ones that we have specifically in this Gospel of John were written so that we might believe and by believing that we would have life in your name Jesus may our belief in you not just bring comfort in the day to day although we know you give us that and you provide for us but father may we take refuge and comfort knowing that you are living water you are what our soul our heart desires you are what we truly long for and Jesus we are sorry for the times where we have desired and wanted things that were material things that were that will spoil things that will rot away but father in this moment may we come back may we fall at your feet and remember how good you are remember how faithful you are even when we are faithless remind us who you are humble us Jesus may we fall at your feet father may we worship you in spirit and in truth may we worship you with all that we have all that we are maybe worship you in light of your law which shows us your character which shows us which shows us your character which shows us what you desire shows us how we fall in short may we also praise you for what you've done by coming to this earth Jesus living a perfect life so that we don't have to Jesus we love you we thank you we praise you it's in your name amen
