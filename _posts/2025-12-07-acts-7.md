## Transcription

All right.

Well, I hope you're doing well this morning.

We're going to jump right into the text because Acts chapter 7 is jam-packed.

There is so much here.

Typically, we would read the whole passage and then we'd kind of break it down, but in my preparation this week, I felt like I'm leaving more out than I'm putting in.

And you're going to see I'm sparing no change, okay?

So, we're going to jump right in.

Acts chapter 7.

Let me give us some context.

At the end of Acts 6, we'll see Stephen is seized.

He's taken in front of some of the religious leaders.

And this is what Stephen has been accused of in Acts chapter 6.

See, he is accused of blasphemous words against God, against Moses, and the temple.

So, that's what their whole gripe is against.

That Stephen has spoken blasphemous words against God, against Moses, and the temple.

So, chapter 7 opens with the high priest saying, are these things so?

Right?

That's what it says in verse 1.

And then in verse 2, Stephen replies.

And Stephen here, it's supposed to be a defense of himself, but he's not really defending himself.

He's going to give a history of a selective history of the Jews and of what we would see in our Old Testament.

And it's a selective history, and he's kind of highlighting some major themes and some key points.

And so, he's not really defending himself.

He's using the scriptures to show the Pharisees and the religious leaders how they're wrong, essentially.

So, he's taking on the offensive here in his reply.

And so, the high priest said, are these things so?

And Stephen, verse 2, said, Brothers and fathers, hear me.

The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, Go out from your land and from your kindred, and go into the land that I will show you.

Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran.

And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living.

Yet, he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child.

And God spoke to this effect, that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years.

But I will judge the nation that they serve, said God.

And after that, they shall come out and worship me in this place.

And he gave him the covenant of circumcision.

And so, Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day.

And Isaac became the father of Jacob and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.

So, the first person that we see Stephen focus in on, on this selective retelling of the Old Testament, is Abraham.

But if we were to look a little closely in verse 2 and 3, we see that God appeared to our father Abraham and said to him.

God said to him.

So, although he is mentioning Abraham, the person in focus is God, not necessarily Abraham.

And the point that Stephen is trying to make is how God spoke to Abraham and God appeared to Abraham, not in a temple or a holy city, but outside of that.

Stephen highlights that the promise to Abraham was not immediate, but how generations later, Abraham's offspring would step foot into the land promised to him.

Remember, that Stephen is on trial for speaking blasphemous, for blaspheming against the temple of all things.

God, Moses, and the temple.

And so, this first point that Stephen is making is, Hey, God is not limited to a temple.

God is not limited to a specific place.

Then in verse 8.

And he gave the covenant of circumcision, which circumcision was a sign of the covenant, and Stephen mentions how Abraham circumcised Isaac.

Again, this is a sign of obedience to God, which at the end of Stephen's sermon, he will call these Jews uncircumcised in heart and mind.

What he's really trying to get at is that what matters is not the external signs of circumcision, but God's promise and obedience to God and his word.

That's what Stephen is emphasizing with the covenant of circumcision.

So, God speaks to Abraham.

And what is Stephen emphasizing here?

That God is not limited to a temple or a holy place.

We're going to see this here.

So, remember that in the back of your head.

Then Abraham, then Isaac, and then Jacob.

And Jacob had the 12 patriarchs.

And now we turn to verse 9 through 16.

And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt, but God was with him, and rescued him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household.

Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food.

But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit.

And on the second visit, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.

And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob, his father, and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all.

And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, and our fathers.

And they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor and Shechem.

And those seven verses, we get like twenty chapters in Genesis.

So, like I said, this is a very selective retelling of the Old Testament.

But, again, Father Abraham had many sons.

Many sons had Father Abraham, right?

And, yeah, we are one of them, and so are you.

But that's not what's in focus in this text.

He goes down the line.

Abraham had Isaac, and then Jacob.

And then Jacob had the twelve patriarchs, the twelve tribes of Israel.

Again, Jacob's name is after he wrestles with God.

The text tells us that God changes his name to Israel.

And then he has these twelve sons and the twelve tribes of Israel.

And so when Stephen says, And our fathers could find no food.

That's in verse 11.

He's literally talking about their ancestors.

So, okay, we see Abraham in focus, and now the next person in focus gets to Joseph.

And what happens with Joseph?

Essentially, he's sold into slavery by his brothers, and that's kind of the first fall of the domino of bad things that happened to Joseph.

But if we were to take a step back even further, we would see another major theme here is introduced by Stephen.

That the people of God rejecting God's chosen leaders.

Okay, Joseph, why was he sold into slavery by his brothers?

Because he got the Technicolor dream coat.

Remember, maybe my favorite story as a little kid.

And he was kind of chosen by his father.

It was his father's favorite son, and there's reasons to why, but we're not going to get into all that right now because time.

And his brothers turned to hate him.

And then Joseph goes on to tell them how he's having these dreams, and essentially in the dreams Joseph is leading and reigning over his brothers, and his brothers hate that dream.

And so what do they in turn do to Joseph?

They sell him into slavery because they can't stand him.

They hate him.

And, of course, his dreams were prophetic of what would happen.

But he was God's chosen leader of Israel at the time.

And what did the people of God or the sons of Israel do to Joseph?

They sell him into slavery.

And so another major theme here that we're going to see in Acts chapter 7 is the people of God rejecting God's chosen leaders.

So if you're keeping track, major themes.

God speaks wherever he wants.

The people of God rejecting God's chosen leaders.

We see here in verse 9 that God was with him.

Who's he talking about?

Joseph.

God was with Joseph.

And Joseph is a story that's marked by adversity.

He faces adversity and God blessing him.

There's blessing in the midst of that adversity.

Now, as we turn to Acts 7 verse 17 through 22, we're going to be introduced to Moses.

And Moses in this sermon is going to be introduced in three 40-year increments.

I told you this is a lot.

We doing okay?

We doing all right so far?

Okay.

So the story of Moses is going to be put in three different 40-year increments.

And we're going to break those down 40 by 40 by 40.

Okay?

Yeah.

Here we go.

Acts 7 verses 17 through 22.

But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph.

He dealt shrewdly with all our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants so that they would not be kept alive.

Okay.

If you're keeping track or wondering where we are in the Old Testament, we just went from Genesis to Exodus.

This is how Exodus begins.

How the Israelites were in Egypt.

And when Joseph was in charge, everyone loved him.

The Pharaoh loved him.

And then years go by.

And the Israelites are being fruitful and multiplying.

And now the Egyptian Pharaoh is like, Yo, what just happened?

These people who were with us have now overtaken us.

What is going on here?

And then they start killing their children.

Let's continue here.

Verse 20.

Moses was born.

And he was beautiful in God's sight.

And he was brought up for three months in his father's house.

And when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.

And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.

And he was mighty in his words and deeds.

You guys want an extra little nugget?

Or should we?

Okay.

So if we look at verse 17, this is just for you, Riley.

When we look at in verse 17, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt.

This might have been, by Luke, a little Easter egg to Luke's readers of the growth of the early church.

Okay.

I think it's pretty cool.

And Luke could be nudging that Israel's oppression in Egypt, that there's a link with the persecution by the Jewish leaders of the followers of Jesus.

Who, of course, represent an ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham.

Okay.

You said you want a little extra little nuggets.

There you go.

Anytime.

Moses introduced...

What do we see here in these five or so verses?

Moses is introduced as a savior type figure in this first summary of 40 years.

Right?

The text tells us that Moses is one of God's chosen leaders and he was beautiful in God's sight.

Right?

That's 20.

Verse 20 there.

That he was beautiful in God's sight.

And, of course, God, through the story that we see in Exodus of Moses' mom putting him in the basket, putting him in the river among the reeds.

And then Pharaoh's daughter goes and finds this little baby and then she's like, Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Can we keep him?

Who made you a ruler and judge over us?

Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?

At this retort, Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian where he became the father of two sons.

Okay, what do we see in this text?

Yet again, we see one of God's chosen leaders, Moses, being rejected by the nation of Israel.

In verse 27, it said, Who made you a ruler and judge over us?

So yet again, we see the people of God rejecting God's chosen leader.

Verse 30 through 34.

Now when forty years had passed.

See, I was telling you about the forty years.

This is the third time now.

This is the third movement.

You guys are doing great.

Now when the forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai in a flame of fire in a bush.

When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight.

And he drew near to look, and there came a voice of the Lord.

I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob.

And Moses trembled and did not dare look.

Then the Lord said to him, Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.

I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them.

And now I will send you to Egypt.

God is again revealing himself.

Not in a temple, or a holy land, but in a burning bush.

And how does this burning bush address Moses?

It says, Take off your sandals.

The place where you are standing is holy ground.

So yet again, we see God not being limited to a temple, or to a specific place.

But God speaking wherever God speaks.

Moses was rejected by the sons of Israel.

But yet here he is approaching the God of Israel.

Verse 35 through 43.

This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge?

This man God sent as both ruler and redeemer, by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.

This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt, and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for four years.

This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.

This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai and with our fathers.

He received the living oracles to give to us.

Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt, saying to Aaron, Aaron, make for us gods who will go before us, as for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt.

We do not know what has become of him.

And they made a calf in those days, and offering a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands.

But God turned away and gave them over to worship the hosts of heaven, as it is written in the Book of the Prophets.

Did you bring me slain beasts and sacrifices during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

You took up the tent of Moloch, and the star of your god, Rephan, and the images that you made to worship.

And I will send you into exile beyond Babylon." Okay, so this final forty year period of Moses is focused in on the forty years in the wilderness.

And Stephen emphasizes Moses was sent by God as both ruler and redeemer.

And he also emphasized the signs and wonders that he performed.

Then in verse 37 we get this little nugget.

And this is the Moses who you said that God will raise up for you a prophet like me.

And in that text there in verse 37, Moses was referring to Jesus eventually.

And so is Stephen.

Jesus was sent by God as a ruler and redeemer who performed signs and wonders.

But what about the Israelites?

In verse 39 it tells us...

There we go.

Verse 39, They refused to obey him and turned to Egypt.

They turned to their old ways.

Their slave-like mentality saying to Aaron, Make for us gods who will go before us.

This Moses guy?

We do not know what's come of him.

The Israelites reject God's chosen leaders yet again and begin to worship idols.

And if we were to look at verse 42 and 43 when one of the prophets...

I can't remember which one off the top of my head.

When one of the prophets says, Did you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices during the 40 years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

So essentially the prophet is saying, Hey, did you not...

You didn't...

There were no temple sacrifices.

There were none of this when we were in the desert.

So why are you so fixated on that?

Instead what you did is you took up the tent of Maul.

You took up these idols.

You took up the God of Rephan.

The images that you made to worship.

That's what the prophet says.

The prophets are making this same point.

That the Israelites reject God's chosen leader and begin to worship other idols, worship other things instead of worshiping God and listening to the word of the prophets who are showing them and speaking to them on how they constantly turn to anything but God to worship.

Now in this last movement of Stephen's sermon, we're going to get Joshua, King David, and Solomon all mentioned.

Let's turn here, verse 44.

Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen.

Our fathers, in turn, brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our fathers.

So it was until the days of David who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob, but it was Solomon who built a house for him.

Yet, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands.

As the prophet says, Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool.

What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord?

Or what is the place of my rest?

Did not my hand make all these things?

The emphasis here, yet again, is on a God who is not confined to a temple or a tent, but a God who is the maker of all things, over all things.

The earth is His footstool.

The people of Israel misunderstand and misunderstood worship as taking place in a man-made structure, while failing to see that God has created everything and He demands full obedience, expressed in repentance and in humble acceptance of God's revelation to us.

Now, Stephen begins his closing statements.

And if these people were not offended yet, they about to be.

Verse 51, You stiff-necked people.

Straight out the gate.

Uncircumcised in heart and ears.

You always resist the Holy Spirit.

As your fathers did, so do you.

Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute?

And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels, and did not keep it.

So Stephen starts to wrap up his sermon by telling these Jewish leaders that they are stiff-necked or stubborn.

And this is a characteristic that is shared with the Israelites during the time of the Exodus and their wilderness wanderings.

The Jews in the wilderness and the Sanhedrin both refused to yield to the presence of God and to God's chosen leaders.

Stephen also says that these leaders are uncircumcised in heart and ears.

Meaning, that they are disobedient to Israel's covenant.

They are disobedient to Israel's covenant God, who fulfilled His promise in Jesus, the Righteous One.

It was by faith that Abraham was obedient to God, and was obedient through circumcision, which was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham.

And the Jewish leaders, they are uncircumcised in heart and ears, because they failed to hear and accept the word of God in Jesus Christ.

So they might have had the look of obedience, but their hearts and their ears were not obedient.

And it is because of this that they have resisted the Holy Spirit, just as their fathers did.

All of the prophets of old were rejected.

The chosen voices by God to speak to God's people, rejected by God's people.

They are just following in their forefathers' footsteps.

So for them to not resist the Spirit would have meant repentance, faith in and obedience to Jesus Christ.

He also tells them, whom you have now betrayed and murdered.

He is calling back once again, and we have seen this in each of the different sermons that we have covered so far in the book of Acts.

They bring it back to the Israelites there and say, no, you guys murdered Him.

You guys betrayed Him.

You guys betrayed the Righteous One.

And then in verse 54, they were cut to the heart and they received these things with gladness.

No, they heard these things and they were enraged.

And they ground their teeth at Him.

They were not happy.

They ground their teeth.

They were clenching their jaws.

I hope they had a scheduled visit to the dentist after that.

Verse 55, But He, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.

And He said, Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.

This is remarkable.

When we read the Apostles' Creed, when we went over our catechism this morning, what does it say?

That Christ is seated.

When we look at Scripture, all throughout Scripture, even Old Testament, we see Jesus seated at the right hand of God.

But yet the text says that He's standing.

He's standing.

He's standing.

That's crazy.

We can't say exactly why Jesus is standing.

But, Matthew 10, verse 32 says, So everyone who acknowledges Me before man, I will also acknowledge before My Father who is in heaven.

Okay?

So, let's think about that.

If we were to be in a courtroom, who are the people who usually stand?

It's usually the people who are defending, right?

It's usually the defense attorney who's standing and going like, Hey!

They're commanding the courtroom, right?

They're pleading their case.

And so maybe that's what Jesus is doing with Stephen.

Jesus may have stood to plead Stephen's case before God the Father, assuring that though he was found guilty and punished on earth, that he might be found righteous and rewarded in heaven.

Stephen had been confessing Christ before men, and now he sees Christ confessing his servant before God.

What a just crazy, beautiful picture.

Verse 57, But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed together at him.

They were done with Stephen.

They were through with Stephen.

They did not want to hear another word from him.

They are like children on the playground, plugging their ears.

That's what it says.

They stopped their ears and rushed together at him.

That's crazy.

Verse 58, Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him.

And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.

And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, Lord, Jesus, receive my spirit.

And falling to his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them.

And when he had said these things, he fell asleep.

So this shows us how they murdered Stephen.

But let's not forget here that Israel, the Jews, had no power to bring about capital punishment.

They were still under Roman rule, Roman law.

Roman law was that only Rome could give out capital punishment.

And so the question is, did they get the approval from Rome?

Or were they just so enraged in the moment that they broke the law to kill?

Stephen became the first martyr of the church.

And what a bold and spirit-filled witness we see.

As I was thinking about landing this plane, there's a ton of takeaways.

There's a laundry list of takeaways.

Like we could look at it from the Old Testament perspective, or the Old Testament stories that Stephen mentions, like Abraham, of course, who accepted God's promise and God's direction without doubt, and who was willing to leave behind what he knew, embarking on journeys to a place that he had never seen.

And for us, that means like two things.

First, just as Abraham never owned the land that God promised to him, Christians, we Christians are resident aliens.

This is not our eternal home.

We will not be here forever.

We'll be in a new earth forever.

Whether that's this exact earth or a brand new one, we don't need to get into that debate.

But right here and now in this lifetime, we are resident aliens.

Here on earth waiting for our inheritance, which is eternal life with Christ.

And how often do you and I get so worldly focused?

We think the things of this present life is the most important thing.

But yet, as authentic Christians, authentic Christians know that we are just merely passing through.

That doesn't mean the things that we go through are meaningless or unimportant.

But is your life ruled by the word of God and his eternal home for you?

Or is your life ruled by this world and this present age?

That could be a great takeaway.

Or Joseph, right?

God protected and blessed Joseph even in the midst of terrible life circumstances.

And yet, believers in Jesus Christ are always under the protection of God's providence.

So whatever we are going through in the here and now is, we are protected.

And we need to be reminded of that.

But what I really want us to focus in on, is Stephen.

Because he reminds us what an authentic witness of Jesus is.

It is a person, full of the Holy Spirit, willing to serve at tables.

It is a person who is active in proclaiming the message of Jesus Christ.

Unfazed by opposition.

Capable of explaining the significance and meaning of the gospel.

Unwilling to compromise his convictions.

Willing to die for his faith, which he regarded as more precious than his own life.

And loving people who have not yet accepted the gospel, even his enemies.

But let's notice, throughout this whole story with Stephen, Luke's emphasis is not Stephen's courage.

But the presence of the Holy Spirit in his life.

And so my question for you is, what will be the emphasis of your life?

Will the emphasis be your achievements?

Your accomplishments?

Or will people remember the power and presence of the Holy Spirit in your life?

I've got a real practical question for us.

As we think about this.

What am I afraid to do that I am uncomfortable having not yet done for the glory of God?

What am I afraid to do that I am uncomfortable having not yet done for the glory of God?

If you do that thing that you are afraid to do, but yet if you are honest about it, you are uncomfortable in the fact that you haven't done it yet.

You haven't acted on that thing yet.

What is it?

And what are you waiting for?

That is most likely the Holy Spirit guiding you to honor and glorify God.

It could be a conversation you need to have.

Admitting a behavior is dishonoring God and it's time to get help or it's time to quit or it's time to change.

Maybe even just this morning as we look at Stephen you go, man, I need to read my Bible more but I don't know how, I don't know where to start.

Maybe for you it's, I haven't started doing family church or family worship with the people in my home.

I'm nervous to sing.

I'm nervous to lead.

What if my kid asked me a question and I don't know the right answer?

God is not looking for your knowledge or wisdom.

He wants your obedience and He'll cover the rest.

He'll cover the rest.

For all these things that we're afraid to do, God is asking you to do something.

We're not talking about salvation here.

That's only possible through Jesus' finished work on the cross.

Abraham was considered righteous by faith but his obedience to God followed and Abraham was not a perfect follower.

He was disobedient.

That's what we're talking about here.

What are you afraid to do that you are uncomfortable having not yet done for the glory of God?

What are you afraid to do that you are uncomfortable having not yet done for the glory of God?

Lord, we thank you for who you are.

We thank you for speaking to us.

We thank you that you desire us to be obedient to you and that you've given us the power to do so not in our own strength but through the power of your Spirit.

And so Holy Spirit, would you speak to us?

And would we act on those things that we are afraid to do?

For your glory.

Father, we ask that you would continue to move in us and speak to us.

Lord, we desire to follow you and to be obedient to the things that you've called us to.

We love you, Lord, and it's in your name.

Everyone said amen and amen.

Thank you for being here this morning.

I pray you have a great week.

We'll see you next Sunday.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.
