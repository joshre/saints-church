## Transcription

John 16, verses 16-33.

A little while, and you will see me no longer, and again a little while, and you will see me.

So some of his disciples said to one another, What is this he says to us?

A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, you will see me.

And because I am going to the Father.

So they were saying, what does he mean by a little while?

We do not know what he's talking about.

Jesus knew that he wanted to ask, what they wanted to ask him, and so he said to them, Is this what you are asking yourself, what I meant by saying a little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?

Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice.

You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy.

When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come.

But when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish for joy that a human being has been born into the world.

So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice.

No one will take your joy from you.

And that day you will ask nothing of me.

Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.

Until now you have asked nothing in my name.

Ask and you will receive, that your joy may be full.

I have said these things to you in figures of speech.

The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.

And that day you will ask in my name, and I do not.

And I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf.

For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God.

I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father.

His disciples said, Ah, now you are speaking plainly, and do not use figurative speech.

Now we know that you know all things, and do not need anyone to question you.

This is why we believe that you came from God.

Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?

Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and you will leave me alone.

Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.

I have said these things to you, that in me you have peace.

In the world you will have tribulation, but take heart, I have overcome the world.

Thank you.

So, some context of where we're at.

I mentioned that we're in the Fairwell Discourse.

We started the Fairwell Discourse in chapter 14.

So, and to give some context to where we are in general, because this is kind of starting to close out a chunk of scripture right before Christ goes to the cross.

This is Thursday evening, we're in the upper room.

What happened before, like four days before was Sunday, was the beginning, the night before Passover, and Christ enters into Jerusalem on a donkey.

Just before that, they'd say that Lazarus home, where Mary poured the extensive nard on Jesus.

Sunday enters in.

Monday through Wednesday, he's doing the signs in and around the temple.

And then, on Thursday, he sends his disciples to go and prepare a room.

In that room, we have the foot washing.

We have Christ saying, one of you is going to betray me.

And then, he sends off Judas.

We also have Peter kind of puffing his chest up and Christ rebuking him.

And now, we're into Fairwell Discourse.

Just a quick summary of what's going on there in 14.

I'll just kind of hit some bullets.

Where he says, he's going to prepare a place.

He's the way and the truth and the life.

Whoever has seen him and seen the Father, then he's going to send the Holy Spirit.

We'll remind them of Christ's ministry and reveal the truth of the lives of what happened there.

Then, there's 15.

He is the true vine.

The Father is the vine dresser.

We bear his fruit.

He prunes.

He tends and disciplines his saints to produce fruit.

Christ chose us.

We're laying down our life for our brothers and sisters. 16, last week.

I still have many things to say to you, which is wild because there's so much that he already has said here.

And all of this is in moments for the disciples.

So, we've taken, this is week 9 of the Fairwell Discourse, just because of how much is in here.

And, so just keep in mind as we're going through this, that what the disciples are hearing is a ton of theology.

Theology that doesn't match their old theology in many ways, or what they thought didn't match it.

And then, just after this, Christ will have his, what's called his High Priestly Prayer, where he prays, where it kind of just flies on the wall to it.

He prays to the Father right before he goes to Gethsemane, to walk across the Kingdom Valley.

And that's when Judas leads Caiaphas to then take Jesus.

So, these are Jesus' final recorded words of encouragement to his disciples.

Depending how you read it, they're his kind of like final words to them.

There are some things he says even from the cross, but here's the final kind of hurrah he gives them.

And then, that moment when Caiaphas comes and takes him, that's only just after midnight.

So, so much is happening on just this Thursday.

And that will be in another, depending how Nate breaks the pericopes down, another couple weeks, maybe a month or two.

So, as we enter into this, we've just heard Christ say that, I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.

Which feels pretty true, because there's so much here.

And then, we see this start to like break the disciples down.

Starting with a little while.

So, a little while and you'll see me no longer.

And again, in a little while, you will see me.

Keeping in mind here that Christ in 24 hours will be in a tomb.

And he'll be all packed up in a house.

So, quite literally, they will not see him.

And then, after which, we'll see in the Gospels that Jesus then appeared to them.

So, some of his disciples said to one another, what is this that he says to us?

A little while and you will not see me.

And again, a little while and you will see me.

And because I'm going to the Father.

So, they were saying, what does he mean by a little while?

We do not know what he's talking about.

And here, they would know what he's talking about.

Because he's been saying for weeks, he's going to be going to the cross.

He's telling them that he's going to sacrifice himself.

You can kind of see them starting to spin as they're getting loaded down with the ups and downs of Christ washing their feet.

As strange as that was, Peter keeps kind of standing up and saying crazy things.

And Christ keeps rebuking him.

And then, they're trying to understand how good Jewish boys understand that there's three persons in the Trinity, as well as this future for Israel that they were picturing was going to be on the side that came and took over.

And now, he's saying he's going to go be killed and put on a cross.

And in many cases, they're also thinking we're never going to see him again.

So, you can see Christ knowing that ahead of time and starting to tell them, you will see me.

But it's not new.

And there was a commentator that made this really good point.

It's kind of like a child to their father when he's leaving the house, saying, where are you going?

Less interested in where their dad is going.

More interested in why you believe in me.

And you can see that starting to like the anxiety and anguish starting to deepen with the disciples.

And then, it just keeps repeating this little while, little while, little while.

And, you know, John clearly is trying to make it a point that in this section, Christ is talking about his resurrection and coming back.

Something that we could take for granted, but the disciples couldn't really even grok at that time.

And he goes on to say, Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him.

So, he said to them, is this what you're asking yourselves?

What I meant by saying a little while and you will not see me.

And again, a little while and you will see me.

It's interesting here is that it kind of feels like it's moving quickly.

But at the same time, there's room for them to be murmuring to each other.

So much so that it seems like he hears them.

Why do you want to ask this?

So, there's just this interesting moment where he then identifies it and then says it again and again.

I think it's John trying to be very clear.

It says, So, this first little while you will be weeping and bitterly mourning, which then we do see the disciples locked away and they're sure that they've lost him forever.

On top of that, they're mourning that they've just abandoned him, that they've all in their own ways scattered.

That we'll see at the end of this chapter that he says, you all will disappear from me, but I won't be alone because the father will be with me.

But in the next little while, your sorrow will turn to joy and no one can take that joy from you.

And this is kind of where this chapter takes this turn.

It hinges on this new creation theme that Christ is talking about that will happen with his resurrection, with him dying on the cross and with his resurrection.

So, it doesn't seem like I haven't had a child before.

I don't think he's making light of childbirth, that it was something that you simply forget it being hard.

But talking about new creation coming from great pain and great suffering.

And Christ going to the cross is him doing that.

He also is kind of touching on this new creation theme that comes all throughout the Old Testament.

It's really common to talk about new life through birth.

And he's quoting Isaiah 26 in some ways.

He's also quoting Isaiah 66.

There's some stuff.

And Ezekiel is quoting, naturally, the one who inspired the word, would have been seeping in the word as a child.

And then it kind of pours forth in him.

But Isaiah 66, I'm going to read some of it because this birth leading into this image of the gospel, as well as something that Jesus then says just next in verse 22.

And I'll just read it to us.

It's Isaiah 66, 7 to 14.

Before she was in labor, she gave birth.

Before her pain came upon her, she delivered a son.

Who has heard such a thing?

Who has seen such things?

Shall a land be born in one day?

Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment?

For as soon as Zion was in labor, she brought forth her children.

Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth, says the Lord?

Shall I, who caused to bring forth, shut the womb, says your God?

Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her.

All you who love her, rejoice with her in joy.

All you who mourn over her, that you may nurse and be satisfied from her consoling breast.

That you may drink deeply with delight from her glorious abundance.

For thus says the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream.

And you shall nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip, and bounced upon her knees.

As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you.

You shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice.

Your bones shall flourish like the grass.

And the hand of the Lord shall be known to his servants.

And he shall show his indignation against his enemies.

So you see there that new creation theme, talking about Jerusalem going out to the nations.

And then we then see that throughout the New Testament, that now first to the Israelites, and then out to the rest of the world.

It's the mission of the first apostles, or the apostles.

And then that leads into this next verse 22.

So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice.

And no one will take your joy from you.

So that your hearts will rejoice.

When you render the Greek, it's the exact same thing as what was there in verse, I don't have the verse numbers here, but in, yeah, 66, 14.

You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice.

Your bones shall flourish like the grass.

So Christ is literally just, he's quoting scripture, which then gives us, as we're looking at, you know, in this moment of despair, this moment of fear, Christ giving us this example of how do we deal with life's problems?

How do we pray?

We do that through the word.

The word is given to us for us to have it written on our hearts.

And spending time in it brings us to it.

Spending time in the Lord's Day in the word brings us back to the word.

But just seeing the creator on earth, the way that he gave an example to his disciples and what felt like their darkest hour, was to simply quote scripture and show that how it pointed to him.

And we see this resurrection being this dawn of new creation.

And throughout the New Testament, we see it.

The fruits, the first fruits of the age to come.

In that day, next verse, verse 23.

In that day, you will ask nothing of me.

Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.

Until now, you have asked nothing in my name.

Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.

So again, this new creation theme, he then goes on to say, in that day.

Which in that day, in the New Testament, pretty much, it essentially is pointing toward the last days, the end of the age, the end of the world.

And we see Christ pointing to the resurrection being the beginning of that age.

It's not, when Jesus is talking about, in that day, you will ask nothing of me.

He's not talking about, like, the end of history is not the period after his resurrection, but that his resurrection itself is the end of history.

It is the thing that ushers in this new age.

And as he said before, I have to leave so that the Helper can come to you.

This is also Christ's ministry on earth coming to an end so that the ministry of the Spirit can start.

And there's some sticky stuff that can come out of this, because any time that people see whatever you ask in my name, he'll give it to you.

Which could, if you're not careful, give a lot of license to whatever you ask from the Lord.

That almost seems like a blank check.

But, in my name here means in accord with who I am and what I've come to do.

So when we look at things like this, we're not to trumpet Christ as a talisman.

Christ is there saying, my will will be done.

The moving forth of my kingdom and my will is what you pray for when you are praying in my name.

So the things that are outside of Christ's will are outside of this promise here.

And then 25 to keep going.

I have said these things to you in figures of speech.

The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but I will tell you plainly about the Father.

So we see the shift from metaphor to clarity.

And what's important is that Christ's primary mission on this earth was his obedience to the law, as well as his obedience to go to the cross willingly.

He then had this earthly ministry that was veiled in parables and figures of speech.

And we see him telling his disciples, I'll speak clearly to you, but to the nations, they're deaf and they cannot hear.

You know, the words he's saying will fall on deaf ears.

His work, and then him going to the cross, then ushers in the Spirit.

And as we saw 14 through 15, the Spirit's mission is illuminating the work that Christ did, as well as applying the work that Christ did.

So, as Nate spoke about last week, that the Spirit applies Christ's work to our lives.

It's this next stage of how God saw redemption working, that he would then send the Spirit who would make things clear.

First, I don't know if I've ever written them down. 14, chapter 14.

Literally. 1426.

But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.

This new age, where the Spirit comes into Pentecost, then gives the clarity to the disciples of what it is that Christ is teaching.

I'll jump forward, I'll jump back.

And, let me go to verse 26 here.

So, we just read about his speech.

In that day, again, you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf.

For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God.

So, then we see, it would have been unthinkable to a good Jewish boy that he could just speak directly to God.

That he would have that direct relationship with the Father.

That you've got the whole priestly system for communication, for the atonement of sin, and here Christ is saying, you don't even have to ask in my name.

That because you believe in me, the Father will hear you.

It's not you coming and requesting, please tell the Father this.

The Father hears because you ask in my name.

I came from the Father, and have come into the world, and now I'm leaving the world and going to the Father.

So, as we just saw in that discussion about Christ's mission, and then the Spirit's mission coming through, he then just gives us a summary of his mission.

He pretty much gives us a summary of his mission here.

I came from the Father, so that's showing Christ being an envoy of the Trinity, and coming to earth into the world.

I came into the world, his incarnation, his humiliation, obedience.

And then, I'm leaving the world, and then I'm going back to the Father, which would be his ascension.

And then, the helper, the paraclete, being sent.

Then, the Holy Spirit is sent.

So, he says, in 25, he's saying, I have said these things to you in figures of speech.

And then, when we go into 29, it appears his disciples think that he's already speaking without figures of speech.

His disciples said, ah, now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech.

Now we know that all things, now we know that you know all things, and do not need anyone to question you.

This is why we believe that you came from God.

Part of you, part of me, is like, was it Peter?

Because it sounds like everything Peter said before.

We're like, the chest pounding, it's the like, we get it.

And I feel like I can very frequently be here as a Christian.

It's like, I understand what you're saying, I understand what you're doing.

And find confusion on the other end of it.

And why do I turn it that way?

Because, though we don't have the inflection, we have what Jesus says after he answers them.

He says, Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?

Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and will leave me alone.

In this declaration, kind of like Peter, I will follow you to the end.

I'm going where you cannot go.

And here they are saying, we believe, we get it, we totally understand.

He's like, oh, do you believe?

Because if you did believe, you wouldn't scatter, you would stay with me to the very end.

And then there's Christ kind of speaking to this comfort that we have in him and in the Father, but speaking of it at this time with the Father.

Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.

Which then is an example for us as Christians for what it is like to be pilgrims in this world.

That we have Christ with us.

We have the Father with us.

We have the Spirit guiding us and who has given us this word.

And a God who has walked this earth and experienced the shackles of temptation and sin, trying to levy against him, yet he withstood it.

So he knows our walk and our struggle.

And then he says, I'm all alone, for the Father is with me.

And, sorry guys, jumping around there, but there's this quote that was really, really good that I read in one of these commentaries from Charles Dodd.

Just talking about the disciples and how we can relate to them and what the church itself is.

Because we kind of see, I mean, we can kind of see them as goofballs here, but we can also see them as like the heroes of the faith at times.

Because part of the character and genius of the church is that its foundational members were discredited men.

It owed its existence not to their faith, courage, or to their virtue, but to what Christ had done with them, and this they could never forget.

And then you see that as they, right now, fumble their way through being his followers, disappear and hide into a house, deny him in front of a little girl.

And then they go on to have the ministry of the disciples to give us this New Testament with the aid of the Spirit.

And then Christ goes on to say, I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace.

In the world you will have tribulation, but take heart, I have overcome the world.

We just had Christ saying that all of you will be scattered, and you will leave me alone.

And now he looks past the defection that he knows will come, and exhorts them.

It's this moment where, again, these are his final words of exhortation to his disciples.

And he doesn't spend time telling them how they should repent, how they should step back from it.

He encourages them that when you are locked away in a room, do not worry.

You just spend a lot of time saying, you will see me again, and your joy will be complete.

No one can take your joy from you.

And now, I have overcome the world.

In the world you will have tribulation.

Something for us to expect is that it's not all roses, it's not all easy.

And there's even just this confirmation that we are not with the Lord yet.

We are in this broken world, and we have an answer as Christians for why we see the brokenness that we do.

Yet, take heart, I have overcome the world.

He's crushed the devil and crushed the world.

At this point, too, he's not gone to the cross, but Christ does know he's done what he's supposed to.

He's been obedient, so he goes to the cross triumphant, knowing that he will be a triumphant king.

I was on the phone with Nate talking about, actually this verse especially, but talking about this section.

And he brought up that, take heart here in the Greek.

Blame Nate for getting into the Greek, not me.

But, take heart here is in the imperative.

So, imperative, usually it's indicating a command of some sort.

So, take heart being in the imperative mood.

It is not Christ saying, I encourage you to take heart.

Like, you ought to, you should.

It is command.

So, Christ, as he's about to go to the cross, his final words of exhortation are, I command you to take heart.

Have courage, have confidence, because the one who gave you the ability to have faith in the first place has told you to be courageous and have confidence.

So, that as the struggles of life come along, we have this otherworldly view of who the Lord says that we are, which are his children that are simply pilgrims in the world.

And, to not take heart because it's something we want to do, but take heart because it's something we've been commanded to.

The times that we do need to take heart are usually the times where we're not going to want to.

And, how often do we find ourselves in the same place as the disciples here, where we have this confidence that we will go wherever the Lord sends us, and we'll do whatever the Lord asks us to do.

I find this for myself, that then I fall so short of it.

Yet, here we have our Savior with a comforting, loving voice telling us that he's overcome the world and crushed the devil.

So, that's all of that verse.

Next, we'll jump into Christ's high priestly prayer, and then the drum beat starts speeding up as he is led to the cross.

I'll pray for us, and then...

Father, we thank you that you have given us your word, and that it is good, it is inerrant, it is the truth of who you are and what you've done.

That your word gives us a history of how you made us, it gives predictions of what you would do, it gives indications of how you did do that, and then tells us what you will do in the future.

We thank you that as we walk this earth, we are in this new age that the Spirit, as a guide of these disciples, now guides us to go out to our neighbors, and to be simply pilgrims in the world that many times wants to crush us.

As you told your disciples, when they are sorrowful, the world will be rejoicing and dancing over your grave.

We know more that you are the victor in that, and that because you have done that, we have confidence that what is in this life is dross, will fade and be gone.

And what we do have is we are never alone because we have you.

And we pray, Lord, that you would give us faith in the times that we don't have the faith to believe that, that that matters more.

We pray that you give us heavenly eyes for these things, that the things that we desire would be your will, that it would be your kingdom, the growth of your kingdom, and to bring you glory and honor.

And we thank you, Lord, that you did glorify your Son, and that you'd insight your Spirit.

We thank you for a wonderful Sunday.

We thank you for a church where we can come together and be in fellowship with one another.

We love you, Lord, and we pray all of this in Jesus' name.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.
