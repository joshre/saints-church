## Transcription

John 16 verses 16 through 33 A little while and you will see me no longer and again a little while and you will see me So some of his disciples said to one another what is this he says to us a Little while and you will not see me and again a little while you will see him because I'm going to the father So they were saying What?

So they're saying what does he mean by a little while we do not know what he's talking about You just knew that he wanted to ask what they wanted to ask him And so he said to him is this what you are asking yourself what I meant by saying a little while And you will not see me and again a little while you will see me Truly truly I say to you you will weep and lament but the world will rejoice You'll be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy when a woman is giving birth She has sorrow because her hour has come But when she has delivered the baby she no longer remembers the anguish for joy that a human being has been born into the world So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice No one will take your joy from you and that day you will ask nothing of me Truly truly I say to you whatever you ask of the father in my name.

It will give it to you Until now you have asked nothing in my name ask and you will receive that your joy may be full I have said these things to you in figures of speech the hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures Of speech, but will tell you plainly about the father and that day you will ask in my name.

I do not And I do not say to you that I will ask the father on your behalf for the father himself loves you because you have loved Me and have believed that I came from God I came from the father and have come into the world now.

I am leaving the world and going to the father His disciples said ah now you're speaking plainly and do not use figurative speech now We know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you This is why we believe that you came from God.

Do you just answer them?

Do you now believe behold the hour is coming indeed?

It has come when it would be scattered each to his own home, and you will leave me alone And I am not alone for the father is with me I have said these things to you the enemy you have peace in the world you will have tribulation, but take art So some context of where we're at I mentioned that we're in the farewell discourse We started the farewell of this course in chapter 14 So and to give some context to where we are in general because this is kind of starting to close out a chunk of scripture right before Christ goes to the cross This is Thursday evening.

We're in the upper room what happened before four days before was Sunday was the beginning the night before Passover and Christ enters into Jerusalem on a donkey just before that they'd see that Lazarus hung one word Mary it poured the extensive Nard on Jesus Sunday enters in Monday through Wednesday.

He's doing the signs in and around the temple and then On Thursday he sends his disciples to go prepare room.

Yeah in that room you have the foot washing we have Christ saying one of you is going to betray me and then sends off Judas we also have Peter kind of sit like puffing his chest up and Christ rebuking him and Now we're into farewell discourse just a quick summary of what's going on there 14 I'll just kind of hit some bullets.

He's where he says he can prepare a place He's the way and the truth in life Whoever has seen him has seen the father then he's gonna send the Holy Spirit will remind them of Christ's ministry and reveal the truth of the lines what happened there, then there's 15 He is the true vine the father is the vine dresser.

We bear his fruit He prunes he tends and disciplines his his Saints To produce fruit Christ chose us.

We're laid down our life for our brothers and sisters 16 last week, but I still have many things to say to you Which is wild because there's so much that he already has said here And all of this is in Moments for the disciples.

So we've taken this is week nine of referral discourse just because how much is in here?

And So just keep in mind as we're going through this that what the disciples are hearing is a ton of theology theology that doesn't match their old theology in many ways or what they thought didn't match it and then Just after this Christ will have his what's called his high priestly prayer where he prays We're kind of just flies on the wall to it prays to the father right before he goes to Get 70 walk across the keeping Valley and That's when Judas leads Caiaphas and then take Jesus so These are Jesus's final recorded words of encouragement to his disciples Depending how you read it.

There is kind of final words to them.

There are some things he says even from the cross But here's the final kind of hurrah he gives them and Then that moment when Caiaphas comes and takes him that's only just after midnight So so much is happening on just this Thursday And that will be in another Depending how Nate breaks the prick of peace down another couple weeks, maybe a month or two.

So as we enter into this We've just heard Christ say that I still have many things to say to you But you cannot bear them now Which feels pretty true because there's so much here and then we see this start to like break the disciples down Starting with a little while so a little while and you'll see me no longer and again in a little while you will see Keeping in mind here that Christ in 24 hours will be in a tomb and it'll be all packed up in a house so quite literally they will not see him and Then after which we'll see in the Gospels that Jesus then appeared to them, so Some of his disciples said to one another What is this that he says to us a little while and you will not see me and again a little while and you will See me and because I'm going to the father so they were saying what does he mean by a little while?

We do not know what he's talking about And here it kind of they would know what he's talking about because he's been saying for weeks.

He's going to be going to the cross He's telling them that he's going to sacrifice himself.

You can kind of see them turning to spin as they're getting loaded down with The ups and downs of Christ washing their feet how strange that was as Peter keeps kind of standing up and saying crazy things and Christ keeps rebuking him and then He's they're trying to understand how the good Jewish boys understand that there's three persons in the Trinity as well as This future for Israel that they were picturing was going to be on the side that came and took over and now he's saying he's Going to go be killed and put on the cross And in many cases they're also thinking we're never going to see him again So you can see Christ knowing that ahead of time and starting to tell them you will see me But it's not new and there was a comment here that made this really good point It's it's kind of like a child to their father when he's leaving saying leaving the house Saying where are you going?

Less interested in where their dad is going more interested in why you believe me And you can see that starting to like the anxiety and anguish starting to deepen with the disciples and then it just keeps repeating this little while a little while a little while and John clearly is trying to make it a point that in this section Christ is talking about His resurrection and coming back something that we could take for granted, but the disciples couldn't really even rock at that time He goes on say Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him So he said to them is this what you're asking yourselves what I meant by saying a little while and you will not see me And again a little while and you will see me It's interesting here is that it kind of feels like it's moving quickly But at the same time there's room for them to be murmuring up to each other that so much so that Seems like you hear them Why you want to ask this?

So there's just this interesting interesting moment where he then identifies it Says it again and again.

I think it's John trying to be very clear.

It's truly truly I say to you you will weep and lament but the world would rejoice You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy when a woman is giving birth She has sorrow because her hour has come But when she has delivered the baby she no longer remembers the anguish for the joy that a human being has born into the world So this first little while you will be weeping and bitterly mourning which then we do see his disciples locked away and They're sure that they've lost him forever on top of that their mourning that they've just Abandoned him that they've all in their own ways scattered that we'll see at the end of this Chapter and he says you all will will disappear from me, but I won't be alone because the father will be with me but In the next little while your sorrow will turn to joy and no one can take that joy from you and This is kind of where this chapter takes this turn it hinges on this new creation Theme that Christ is talking about that will happen with his resurrection with him dying on the cross and with his resurrection so it doesn't seem like I haven't I haven't had a child before I don't think he's making light of childbirth that it was You know something that you simply forget it being hard but talking about new creation coming from great pain and great suffering and Christ going to the cross as I'm doing that He also is kind of touching on this New creation theme that comes all throughout the Old Testament is really common to talk about new life through birth And he's quoting Isaiah 26 in some ways He's also quoting Isaiah 66.

There's some second Ezekiel is quoting naturally the one who Inspired the word would have been seeping the word as a child and then it kind of pours forth them in But Isaiah 66 I'm gonna read some of it because this birth Leading into this image of the gospel as well as something Jesus then says just next in verse 22 And I'll just read it to us it's Isaiah 66 7 to 14 Before she was in labor she gave birth before her pain came upon her she delivered a son Who has heard such a thing who has seen such things?

Shall a land be born in one day shall a nation be brought forth in one moment For as soon as Zion was in labor she brought forth her children Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth says the Lord?

Shall I who caused to bring forth shut the womb says your God?

Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her all you who love her Rejoice with her enjoy all you who mourn over her that you may nurse and be satisfied from her consoling breast That you may drink deeply with delight from her glorious abundance for thus says the Lord Behold I will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream And you shall nurse you shall be carried upon her hip and bounced upon her knees As one whom his mother comforts so I will comfort you You shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

You shall see and your heart shall rejoice Your bones shall flourish like the grass and the hand of the Lord shall be known to his servants and he shall show his indignation Against his enemies so you see there that new creation theme talking about Jerusalem going out to the nations And then we then see that throughout the New Testament that now first To do to the Israel Israelites and then out to the rest of the world It's the the mission of the the first apostles of the Apostles And then that leads into this next verse point to you so also you have sorrow now But I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice No one will take your joy from you so that your hearts will rejoice When you render the Greek it's the exact same thing as what was there in verse I have the verse numbers here, but in For yeah, 66 14 you shall see and your heart shall rejoice your bones shall flourish like the grass So the crisis literally just he's quoting scripture Which then gives us as we're looking at you know in this moment of despair It's moment of fear Christ giving us this example of how do we deal with life's problems?

How do we pray we do that through the word the word is given to us for us to have it written on our hearts and Spending time and it brings us to it spending time the Lord saying the word brings us back to the word But just seeing that the creator On earth the way that he exam gave an example of the disciples and what felt like their darkest hour Was to simply quote scripture and show that how it pointed to him And we see this resurrection being this dawn of new creation and throughout the New Testament We see it the fruits the first fruits of the age to come in that day next verse verse 23 in that day You will ask nothing of me Truly truly I say to you whatever you ask of the Father in my name He will give it to you until now you have asked nothing in my name Ask and you will receive that your joy may be full So again this new creation theme and then goes on to say in that day Which in that day in the New Testament pretty much? always it essentially pointing toward the last days the end of the age the end of in the world and We see Christ pointing to this the resurrection being the beginning of that age It's not when Jesus is talking about in that day.

You will ask nothing of me He's not talking about like the end of end of history is not the period after his resurrection But that his resurrection itself is the end of history It is the thing that ushers in this new age and as he said before I have to leave so that the helper can come To you this is also Christ's ministry on Earth coming to an end that the ministry of the spirit can start And there's some sticky stuff that come out of this because anytime that people see whatever you ask in my name He'll give it to you Which could if you're not careful give a lot of license to whatever you ask from the Lord Almost seems like a blank check but in my name here means in accord with who I am and What I've come to do so when we look at things like this.

We're not to trumpet Christ as a talisman Christ is there Saying my will will be done Moving forth of my kingdom and my will is what you pray for when you are praying in my name So the things that are outside of Christ's will are outside of this promise here and 25 to keep going I Said these things to you in figures of speech The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech But I will tell you plainly about the father so we see the shift from metaphor to clarity and What's important is that Christ's primary mission on this earth? this is a on the earth was it is obedience to the law as well as His obedience to go to the cross willingly He then had this earth ministry that was veiled in parables and figures of speech and you see him telling his disciples I'll speak to you, but to the nations I They they're deaf and they cannot hear you know the words he sang will fall on deaf ears His work and then him going to the cross then ushers in the spirit and As we saw 14 through 15 the spirits mission is Illuminating the work that Christ did as well as applying the work that Christ did so as Nate spoke about last week That the spirit applies Christ's work to our lives It's this next stage of how God saw redemption working that he would then send the spirit who would make things clear First 14 14 Chapter 14 1426 but the helper the Holy Spirit whom the father will send in my name He will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you this new age Where the spirit comes in at Pentecost then gives the clarity to the disciples what it is that Christ is teaching And Let me go to verse 26 here.

So we just read about Speech in that day again, you will ask in my name and I do not say to you that I will ask the father on your behalf For the father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God Then we see He would have been unthinkable to a good Jewish boy that he could just speak directly to God That he would have that direct relationship with the father You've got the whole priestly system for communication for the atonement of sin and hear Christ is saying you don't even have to ask on In my name that because you believe in me the father will hear you.

It's not becoming more requesting Please tell the father this the father hears because you ask in my name.

I Came from the father and have come into the world and now I'm leaving the world and going to the father So as we just saw that discussion about Christ's mission and then the spirits mission coming through he then just gives a summary of his mission Pretty much gives a summary of his mission here.

I came from the father So that's showing Christ being an envoy of the Trinity and coming to earth Into the world I came into the world his incarnation humiliation obedience And then I am leaving the world and then I'm going back to the father Ascension and then the helper the paraclete being sent then the Holy Spirit is sent So he says you know in 25 He's saying I have said these things to you and figures of speech And then when we go into 29 it appears as disciples think that he's already speaking without figures of speech His disciples said ah Now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech now We know that all things now that we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you This is why we believe that you came from God Part of you part of me Was it Peter because it sounds like everything Peter said before we're like the chest pounding.

It's still like we get it And I feel like I can very frequently be here as a Christian is like I understand what you're saying I understand what you're doing and Find confusion on the other end of it And why do I turn it that way because though we don't have the inflection we have what Jesus says after he answers them He says Jesus answered them Do you now believe Behold the hour is coming indeed it has come when you will be scattered each to his own home and will leave me alone In this declaration kind of like Peter.

I will follow you to the end I'm going where you cannot go here.

They are saying we believe we get it.

We totally understand He's like, oh do you believe if you did believe you wouldn't scatter you would say with me to the very end and Then there's Christ kind of speaking to this comfort that we have in him and in the father But speaking of it at this time with the father yet.

I am not alone for the father is with me which then is an example for us as Christians for What it is like to be pilgrims in this world that we have Christ with us we have the father with us we have the spirit guiding us and who has given us this word and a God who has walked this earth and experienced the the shackles of temptation and sin trying to Levy against him yet.

He withstood it so he knows our our walk and our struggle Then he says I I'm alone for the father's with me and Sorry guys dripping around there, but there's this quote that was really really good that I read one of these commentaries from Charles Dodd Just talking about the disciples and how we can relate to them and what the church itself is Because we've kind of see I mean we can kind of see this goofball here See them as like the heroes of the faith of times as part of the character and genius of the church Is that its foundational members were discredited men men?

It owed its existence Not to their faith Courage or to their virtue but to what Christ had done with them and this they could never forget and Then you see that as they right now Fumble their way through being his followers disappear and hide into a house deny him in front of a little girl and Then they go on to have the ministry of the disciples to give us this new testament with the aid of the spirit And then Christ goes on to say I have said these things to you that in me you may have peace In the world you will have tribulation but take heart But take heart I have overcome the world we just had Christ saying that all of you will be scattered and you will leave me alone and Now he looks past the defection that he knows will come and exhorts them it's this this moment where again, these are these are his final words of exhortation to his disciples and He doesn't spend time telling them how they Should repent how they should step back from it He encourages them that when you were locked away in a room, do not worry You just spent a lot of time saying you will see me again and your joy will be complete.

No one can take your joy from you and now I Have overcome the world In the world you have tribulation something for us to expect is that it's not all roses.

It's not all easy and There's even just this confirmation that we are Not with the Lord death.

We are in this broken world We have an answer as Christians for why we see the brokenness that we do Yet take heart.

I have overcome the world.

He's crushed the devil and crushed the world at this point, too He's not gone to the cross that Christ does know he's done what he's supposed to he's been obedient So he goes to the cross Triumphant knowing that he would be a triumphant king.

I was on the phone with Nate talking about Actually this verse especially but talking about this this section and he brought up that take heart here in the Greek When Nate for getting in the Greek not me but take heart here is in the imperative.

So imperative usually it's indicating indicating a command of some sort so Take heart being the imperative mood.

It is not Christ saying I encourage you to take heart like me like you ought to you should it is command so Christ as he's about to go to the cross his final words of exhortation are I command you to take heart have courage have confidence Because the one who gave you the ability to have faith in the first place has told you to be courageous and have confidence So that as the struggles of life come along we have this other worldly view of who the Lord says that we are which are his children that are simply pilgrims in the world and To not take heart because it's something we want to do but take heart because it's something we've been commanded to the times that we do need to take heart are usually the times where we're not going to want to and How often do we find ourselves in the same place as the disciples here where?

We have this confidence that we will go wherever the Lord sends us I'm gonna do whatever the Lord asks us to do I find this for myself that then I fall so short of it Yet here we have our Savior with a comforting loving voice telling us that he's overcome the world across the devil Yeah So that's all that first next we jump into Christ's high priesthood prayer and then The drumbeats are speeding up as he is led to the cross I'll pray for us and then Father we thank you that you have given us your word and that it is Good it is inerrant.

It is the truth of who you are and what you've done That your word Gives us a history of how You made us It gives predictions of what you would do it gives indications of how you did do that and then tells us what you will do in the future Thank you that as we walk this earth we are in this new age that the spirit has as a guide of these disciples now guides us to go out to our neighbors and to be simply pilgrims in the world that At many times wants to crush us as you told your disciples When they are sorrowful the war will be rejoicing and dancing over your grave, you know Or that you were the victor and that and that because you have done that We have confidence that What is in this life is dross will fade and Be gone and what we do have is We're never alone because we have you We pray Lord that you would give us faith in the times that we don't have the faith to believe that That that matters more pray that you give us heavenly eyes for these things that The things that we desire would be your will that it would be your kingdom the growth of your kingdom and to bring you glory and honor You are that you did glorify your son And that you then set your spirit We thank you for a wonderful Sunday for a church where we can come together and fellowship with one another We love you Lord, and we pray all of this in Jesus name
