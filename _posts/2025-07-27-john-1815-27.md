## Transcription

Alright, so we see here at the beginning Simon Peter followed Jesus and so did another disciple.

Let's see there, another disciple.

We aren't 100 percent, we can't say with 100 percent certainty who the other disciple was.

Although if we were to look at the context clues and look at the rest of John, John, he never names himself, he always calls himself the disciple in whom Jesus loved.

And so most biblical scholars believe this other disciple was John also based upon just other different context clues we get throughout the text like the random note of it being a charcoal fire.

It had to be someone who wasn't eyewitness to that or else why would you put that in there?

That's not something you go around, man what a lovely charcoal fire, right?

So another disciple, we're going to say it's John, the author of this gospel.

So Peter and John follow Jesus to the courtyard of the high priest and apparently John was known by the high priest because it says that Peter could not go into this courtyard of go in with the high priest because Peter was not known to the high priest.

What we do know about John, it tells us all the way back in the beginning that John probably came from wealth.

Although John was a fisherman, his dad had hired hands so there was somewhat of a boating empire so maybe John's family knew the high priest, that's how the high priest knew that John was who he was.

So because you can only go in if you were known by the high priest and then John says to this servant girl, right there, the servant girl and said, hey he's with me or something to that nature because she's brought in or he's brought in, she brings him in.

Then what do we see?

The servant girl, verse 17, at the door said to Peter, you also are not one of the man's disciples are you?

He said, I am not.

So the servant girl makes a pretty obvious connection, right?

Like they came in together, Peter stayed out of this courtyard of the high priest, this man John sends me to go get this guy so she's like, you're with Jesus aren't you?

Aren't you with him?

And then Peter goes, I'm not.

And of course Jesus foretold Peter that he was going to deny him three times and here is Peter, we can mark one of three, right?

And now verse 18 continues and says, now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire because it was cold and they were standing and warming themselves.

Peter also was with them standing and warming himself.

So we get this detail of the fire and the cold, right?

And this was an indication of it being at night, right?

When did the posse of Roman soldiers and Jewish officers go get Jesus?

They got him with torches and lanterns, with torches not to set the olive grove on fire, not to set the Mount of Olives on fire, but because they needed a light to see.

So we get this at the very beginning of the chapter, we get this notion of it being nighttime.

Then here we see it continuing to be cold and dark and which we are probably not privy to although if we kind of think about it just with common sense.

Like nowadays, when do trials happen?

When are judges in office, in court?

During the day, during the light, not at night.

And yet here we see Jesus being tried at night.

Less people around, less crowd.

So there was a secrecy about this that they did not want everyone to know of.

Verse 19 continues, The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.

Then if we jump down to 24, Anas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

So who's the high priest, right?

It says the high priest right there in verse 19, the high priest, and then it mentions it as Anas.

And then he sends him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

So what's going on here?

So we kind of have a double high priest situation here happening.

So Anas was the proper Jewish high priest.

Is Anas.

But the Romans were in charge, right?

And so they promoted Caiaphas as the Roman high priest.

So there are two high priests, but in Judaism, in ancient Judaism, the high priest, once you were the high priest, you were the high priest for life.

So the Romans being in charge, they said, Anas, sorry bud, you are not high priest.

We're seeing Caiaphas as the high priest.

And so we get this sort of dual high priest.

And so if you were reading that before or even questioning now, who is actually the high priest, depends which side of the coin.

If you're a Jew, then you probably still see Anas as the high priest.

But again, what was their goal here was to get Jesus killed, to get Jesus crucified.

So it cannot stay with just the Jewish court.

They needed to get Rome involved.

And so that's why Anas sends him to Caiaphas, the high priest.

Okay, so now that we have our high priests in order, something else we miss here is the way in which an ancient Jewish trial would play out.

So in ancient Israel, the way it would work is if you were on trial, if you were like Jesus was, the typical order of business was the witnesses on behalf of the accused were called to testify.

So Jesus, those who were in defense of Jesus should have been speaking on account of Jesus.

Jesus did not need to give a testimony for his actions.

Jesus did not need to give an account for what he did wrong, quote unquote.

It was the, there were eyewitnesses who should have spoken up in Jesus' defense.

And then after that person speaks or those people speak, then those against Jesus were to speak up and say, hey, this is what Jesus did wrong.

This is what Jesus happened.

But Anas apparently skips this whole process and immediately questions Jesus, right?

It says right there, verse 19, the high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.

And to which Jesus responds, I have spoken openly to the world.

I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple where all Jews come together.

I have said nothing in secret.

Why do you ask me?

Ask those who have heard me what I said to them.

They know what I said.

Alright.

So Jesus is here going, hey, I've spoken openly to the world.

You can go get somebody who heard what I said.

They know what I've taught.

They understand what I've said.

So why do you ask me?

Go ask somebody else.

Jesus is almost holding them account to the way the Jewish court should have been done, how things should have been in order.

And Jesus says, hey, go ask one of them.

They can speak for me.

And they know what I said.

And then when Jesus said this, somebody was not too happy about it.

When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand saying, is that how you answer the high priest?

Do you talk to your mother with that mouth?

We don't get this detail here in this text, but in other translations, and most likely he's smacking Jesus in the face.

That's what's happening here.

He's not giving him a tap on the shoulder or spanking.

He's smacking him in the face.

Is that how you answer the high priest?

And so they respond.

Jesus answers him, if what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong.

But if what I said is right, why do you strike me?

And it's them sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.

Again, Jesus is going, hey, if I said something wrong, bring a witness.

Interestingly enough, if we were to sort of do a comparative analysis with the other gospels, if we were to look at Mark and Matthew, we do get some testimonies against Jesus, but those testimonies happen in front of Caiaphas, not Annas.

And so truthfully, the trials sort of stop there.

There was no one to find guilt.

They found no guilt with Jesus here in this moment.

But they had a job to do, which was to crucify Jesus.

And so Annas sends him on to the next court.

Verse 25.

Now Simon Peter was standing and warning himself.

So they said to him, you also are not one of his disciples, are you?

He denied it and said, I am not.

One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, did I not see you in the garden with him?

Peter again denied it and at once a rooster crowed.

John is really quite an author here.

He's kind of giving us two different vantage points of the scene playing out, right?

We've got Jesus on trial and he gave us that scene.

And at the same time, he's authoring and telling us what's happening with Peter.

These things are kind of happening simultaneously and he's given us these different vantage points.

But for the rest of our time here this morning, I want us to focus in on Peter and really kind of see and experience what's happening with Peter.

Because I think it's important that we see this, but also before we even dive into this Let's just take a few steps back, flip a couple pages earlier in the book of John and get some broader context on Peter.

Because it can be very easy in this text for us to go, oh Peter, what a joke.

You know, we can kind of just write off Peter in these moments.

But I think if we take a step back, we will see and with some humility see that we are more like Peter than we would like to admit.

You don't have to flip there in your Bibles, I'll put it up here on the screen for just the ease of us flipping around.

John 6, Jesus feeds the 5,000.

Jesus walks on water and then Jesus tells people that he is the bread of life and Jesus goes, eat me, essentially.

That's a Chad GBT summary.

I'm just kidding, I'm giving you that summary.

That's not actually a quote from Chad GBT.

I just feel like you have to clarify those things nowadays.

Then many people leave Jesus.

They're like, whoa, this guy wants us to eat his flesh?

What's up with that?

And so many leave Jesus and then Jesus asks his disciples, the 12 there, and he says, are you going to leave me?

To which Peter replies, Lord, to whom shall we go?

You have the words of eternal life and we have believed and come to know you that you are the Holy One of God.

Okay, so what do we see in this text?

Peter acknowledges Jesus as being from God.

Peter acknowledges Jesus as having the words of eternal life.

That he came from God, that he is holy like God.

That's what Peter acknowledges right here.

Something that probably all of us would admit here in this room.

He says, we would all agree, Jesus has the words of eternal life.

I think we all believe and have come to know that Jesus is the Holy One of God.

As we sung just a few moments ago, that he is seated at the right hand of God.

He is seated on the throne, right?

So we have to acknowledge that Peter knew.

Peter knew Jesus.

Knew who he was.

Knew he was the Messiah.

John 13, let's fast forward even, I guess from John 6, a couple more pages.

Jesus is about to wash the disciples' feet.

Peter is like, no way Jesus, you can't wash my feet.

To then, Peter goes, or no, then Jesus goes, well if I cannot wash your feet, you will have no part with me.

If you do not let me cleanse you, if you do not let me wash you, then you'll have no part with me.

To then Peter goes, where's the bathtub?

Wash my whole body.

That's essentially what Peter says to him.

Then later in John 13, Jesus tells his disciples what he is going to do.

How he is going to die.

And then Peter goes, where are you going, Jesus?

John 13, where am I going, Jesus says.

You cannot follow me now, but you will follow me afterward.

So Jesus is talking here about the cross.

Jesus is going, you cannot follow me to the cross, but afterward you can follow me.

Then Peter goes, Lord, why cannot, why cannot I follow you now?

I will lay down my, that's a bummer, I will lay down my life for you.

Jesus answered, will you lay down your life for me?

Truly, truly I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times.

So again, we have, Peter has this acknowledgement of Jesus as Savior.

We have this acknowledgement of, here in this text, Peter going, I will lay down my life for you.

I will die for you, Jesus.

And so, the, not even a question, but the thing we kind of have to wrestle with before we get into these, before we get into Peter denying Jesus, is what was Peter's psyche going into these final moments?

And I think if we look even earlier on in chapter 18, when Peter tries to fight, literally, takes his sword out, tries to, or dagger, if you will, takes his sword out and is trying to kill a man and just gets his ear instead, we could guesstimate that Peter was looking to fight.

Peter was looking, just like pretty much everyone else at that time, was not looking for a Messiah to be a suffering servant, to not fulfill that Isaiah 53 prophecy.

Peter was probably not in the head space, even though Jesus said, I'm going to die, all these things.

Peter was probably, just like the rest of the disciples, seeing Jesus be arrested, Peter's witnessing this here in these moments that we just looked at, Peter was probably shaken up.

This is not the Messiah that Peter was expecting.

Peter was looking for liberation from Rome, a stand against Caesar.

This was common, even amongst the disciples.

And John actually gives us a glimpse.

Multiple times throughout the gospels, John says that they didn't understand or they did not realize what Jesus was doing until after.

They didn't comprehend what Jesus was doing, what he was teaching until after.

So they were probably too, all just kind of shooken up and like, what is going on?

This is not what I expected.

This is not how I expected my life to be.

This is not how I expected Jesus to, yeah he told us, but it wasn't until after where it made sense.

So this probably wasn't just Peter who doubted, who struggled with Jesus being arrested, who were all just kind of like truthfully dumbfounded at all this.

And so now that we kind of have that context, let's look at the other gospel accounts and sort of piece together and sort of kind of pick and poke and see what's different from these, from Peter being on trial, or sorry, from Jesus being on trial and Peter's denial.

Because there's some things I think that we see that, I'll just get there.

But first, let's quickly define denial.

What is denial?

We all kind of have a basic understanding.

But when we look at the word denial, the definition is to disown or to renounce a relationship.

It's like going like, I want nothing to do with you.

I disown you.

I want absolutely nothing to do with you.

Okay.

So Mark and Matthew have similar, give us similar details.

So we're going to look at Mark, then we're going to look at Luke.

Mark 1472, and immediately the rooster crowed a second time.

And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him.

He remembered and he broke down and wept.

We don't get that in John.

But he remembered, he was like, oh snap.

He remembered and what's his response?

He broke down and wept.

If you think that's bad, Luke gives us one more detail that is going to break your heart.

And if it doesn't, I'm going to pray for you.

Luke 22.

But Peter said to him, man, I do not know what you are talking about.

And immediately while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed and the Lord turned and looked at Peter.

Jesus turned and looked at Peter.

He just heard him.

I disown you.

I want nothing to do with you.

In other context, we see when Peter denies in front of the servant girl, he curses at her.

He curses at a little girl and says, I want nothing to do with you.

And Jesus turned and looked at Peter.

Do you feel that?

He turned and he looked at Peter.

I don't know if you've had to confess sin to someone you love and look them in the eye and do it.

It's not easy.

It'll make you break down and weep bitterly.

It'll make you do that.

And that's what Peter is doing in this moment.

He remembered what Jesus said to him.

He sees Jesus looking at him and he breaks down and he weeps.

Jesus will get tossed around from court to court.

Jesus is smacked in the face.

He's spit upon.

He's whipped and beaten to the point of death.

A crown of thorns is put on his head all before heading to the cross.

And what happens in the midst of all this?

A dear friend, a person who has been by Jesus' side from the very beginning says, I want nothing to do with you.

Yes, Jesus told him it was going to happen.

Jesus told him he was going to betray him.

But do you think that made it any easier to hear?

When I made my vows to Kayla, I told her all the good things, right?

I'll be with you forever.

I'll cherish you.

I will fight for you.

All the great things that you're supposed to say.

I remember in our vows, I also told her I would let her down, that I would disappoint her.

But do you think that makes it any easier when I do?

No way.

It still hurts.

There's still the sting and pain of hurt, of breaking a promise.

Could you imagine how Peter felt?

He felt disgusting.

He probably felt like the scum of the earth.

Could you then imagine Peter denying Jesus, him running out, weeping bitterly, and then watching Jesus go to the cross?

What pain!

What hurt!

Oh!

The guilt.

The shame.

I think we all know that this is not how the story ends.

We can look forward to John 21 and Jesus will have his moment with Peter.

Jesus goes, Peter, do you love me?

Peter says yes, then Jesus tells him, then tend my sheep.

Then if you love me, feed my lambs.

If you love me, feed my sheep.

Right after that, Jesus says to Peter, follow me.

Follow me.

So the question I have for us this morning, what is your response after you mess up big time?

What is your response after you screw up?

Do you stay in the breaking down and weeping?

Do you stay and sulk in the past?

Do you hold on to the past?

Or will you, in the midst of your mess up, allow Jesus to ask you, hey do you love me?

Then follow me.

We must come back to Jesus in repentance, understanding that we have messed up.

We are Peter in this situation.

So what should we do?

We should repent and then what?

Follow Jesus.

Follow Jesus.

Do what he told us to do.

Get back up.

Don't just sulk in the past.

Don't just say, yeah but you wouldn't understand.

I messed up so big.

Yeah, so did Peter.

But then what did Peter do?

We can look to Acts.

Here comes Acts chapter 2.

Peter speaks out, gives the first gospel declaration sermon post Jesus.

Thousands come to know Christ.

Peter will serve and work for the sake of the gospel.

Does Peter continue to get everything right?

No.

But what does he do?

He keeps following Jesus.

Jesus is not surprised by your failure.

He knows it.

He knows you suck.

He knows you screwed up.

He knows you've made mistakes.

But what is our response?

Follow Jesus.

Do what he's called us to do.

Jesus says I know you failed.

I know you betrayed me.

I know you're down and out but get up and follow me.

If there was grace for Peter who made eye contact with Jesus and his denial, there's grace for you and for me.

So get up and follow Jesus.

Stop making, stop acting like everything's terrible.

Things might suck.

Yeah, I get that.

But get up and follow Jesus.

Get up and follow Jesus.

There is mercy for you.

There is grace for you.

So much so that the scriptures tell us that there is mercy made new for us when?

Every morning.

There is grace for you.

There is mercy for you.

So stop sulking in the past.

Get up and follow Jesus because he's given you mercy for today.

He's given you mercy for tomorrow.

He's given you mercy even when you mess up because that's the kind of God we serve to where when we were prodigals, when we disowned Jesus and he sees us come back to him, he doesn't stand up in his ivory tower.

He doesn't stand up and say yeah it's about time you came back.

No, he comes running towards us with his grace and his mercy abundant and says throw the party.

Butcher the calf.

We're having porterhouses tonight people.

Amen.

Hallelujah.

All the butter please.

There is a party going on when every time we return back to him.

So why are you holding back?

Run to your savior.

He's not afraid of your sin.

He's not afraid of your past.

He's not afraid of your mistakes.

In fact scripture tells us while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

There is mercy and grace for you.

So get up and follow him.

Let me pray for us.

Jesus we thank you for your mercy abundant.

We thank you that it is by your grace we have been saved through faith and it's not from ourselves.

It's not by any of our work so that we may not boast.

We cannot boast in what we've done but we praise you and boast for what you have done.

That you took up the cross for us.

That you paid our debt so that we could be made right with you Father.

And so as your people here this morning we pray that through your spirits empowering that we would get up and follow you.

That we would live lives of obedience not for our salvation but from our salvation.

We would obey you and do what you've called us to do.

Live how you've called us to live so that others could come to see how much you love them.

Father may we rest in your mercy and grace.

We thank you that you had grace for Peter.

We thank you that you have grace for us.

And it's in Jesus name everyone said amen.
