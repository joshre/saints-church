## Transcription

Do you want to cross on it, or just ...

I prefer Acacia from the Holy Land.

All right.

Good morning.

It's good to see you guys.

Missed you last week.

Thank you, Josh, for holding it down.

One of the things that I appreciated about the message last week was just the perspective from ...

I think this would now be our 10th week from this Upper Room Discourse.

And again, what happens in moments, we've spent the last 10 or so weeks looking at it.

And so just for the context that this is in one evening, and yet here we are breaking this down.

And when I think about the scriptures ...

Will somebody remind me at the end?

I have an announcement to make, but I'm in this already, so we're going.

Have you ever ...

When we look at the Gospels, when we look at the stories of Jesus, we see him constantly withdraw to pray, right?

Like we could ...

I could think back of ...

I believe it's John chapter 6.

Jesus heals the 5,000, right?

And then right after that, he tells his disciples, hey, go get on a boat.

I'll meet you on the other side.

And then Jesus withdraws himself to pray.

And then, of course, Jesus meets them in the middle of the lake as he walks on water, all that whole thing.

But have you ever wondered and questioned, what does Jesus actually like pray?

And if you're like me, or if you think about it, you go, well, the Lord's Prayer, right?

And that's a fair answer.

Now, of course, in the context of the Lord's Prayer, his disciples are asking him, hey, Jesus, we see you pray.

What should we pray?

And then, of course, he says, you know, when you pray, you pray like this, our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, right?

Which is a good guess, but there's a line in there that Jesus doesn't have to pray.

Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.

Jesus, he doesn't have any debt.

Jesus is Dave Ramsey up in this joint.

He's debt-free.

Right?

In fact, if you want to think about it, Jesus is, he's like the line, the pay it forward line in Starbucks.

He pays our debts.

Come on, somebody.

And so maybe Jesus just omits that line when he prays.

What does Jesus pray when he prays?

That's a great question, which leads us to then John chapter 17, which we get to be flies on the wall and see what Jesus prays.

And so I'd love for us to read this whole chapter.

And then we're just going to look at the first five verses this morning.

We might get two or three weeks in here, so who knows?

But let's read these first five verses because there's a lot here.

And truthfully, I am not doing these five verses justice of what I'm going to share with you this morning.

And I think I'm doing a pretty good job and it's still, I'm just scratching the surface of the depth here in these five verses.

But let's see what Jesus prays.

And again, context.

These are like moments before he's about to be betrayed.

Moments before.

So like, kind of have to think of that.

But now let's, let's read Jesus's words and then we'll jump in.

So if somebody wants to read John 17, that would be amazing.

When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour has come.

Glorify your son that the son may glorify you, since you have given him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom you have given him.

And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you sent.

I glorify you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.

And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.

I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world.

Yours they were, and you gave them to me.

And they have kept your word.

Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you.

For I have given them the words that you gave me.

And they have received them, and have come to know in truth that I came from you.

And they have believed that you sent me.

I am praying for them.

I am not praying for the world, but for those whom you have given me.

For they are yours.

All mine are yours, and yours are mine.

And I am glorified in them.

And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world.

And I am coming to you.

Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one.

While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me.

I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost, except the sum of destruction that the scripture might be fulfilled.

But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

And do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one.

They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

Sanctify them in the truth.

Your word is true.

As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.

And for their sake, I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.

I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.

The glory that you have given me, I have given to them, that they may be one, even as we are one.

I in them, and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me, and love them, even as you love me.

Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me wherever I am, where I am, to see my glory that you have given me, because you loved me before the foundation of the world.

O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me.

I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.

Awesome.

Thank you.

So, uh, we see here, we'll just go straight back to verse one.

When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven.

When we pray, what do we usually do?

Close our heads.

Bow our heads, close our eyes, and pray.

Right?

So cute, so isolated.

Unbiblical!

What does Jesus do?

He lifted up his eyes to heaven, and prays.

What?

What?

I wonder how different our prayer life would be if we made that one subtle posture change.

Instead of being down, somber, we look upward.

We fix our gaze heavenward.

Our posture is not one of inward, of self, but our posture is upward towards heaven.

What?

What a stark contrast, right?

Like, I think the studies say that, like, body language is, like, 80 to 90 percent of our communication.

What does this posture say versus this posture?

Wow.

For some of you, that's all you need is verse one.

Change your prayer posture.

When Jesus had spoken these words, verse one, back to it, he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour has come.

Glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you.

The hour has come.

We've talked about this a few times, but we've seen all throughout the book of John.

We can go all the way back to his first miracle, uh, where he turns water into wine, and Jesus says to his mother, Woman, the hour has not yet come, right?

And he's, he's saying, like, it's not time, like, it's not time for me yet.

The hour has not yet come.

Well, the hour is here.

The hour has come.

And he's crying out to his Father.

The hour has come.

Glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you.

The hour has come for the Son to glorify the Father.

And Jesus asks that God would glorify his Son so that the Son may glorify the Father.

Um, this word, glory, glorify, it's going to be used, um, four, four times in these five verses that we're looking at.

So it's kind of a big deal here.

Um, and so we're going to break this word down.

Can you see that all right?

I know it's a little, I can't see it because of the glare, but I can see it here on my screen.

If you can't see that, I'm sorry.

Um, great.

Uh, the, the Greek word there is doxadzo, and this word refers to praising someone for their high and exalted status or to entering into a state of glory and exaltation.

So there's kind of these two folds of, of, of glory when, when it's being used there.

It's for praising someone for their high and exalted status or entering into a state of glory and exaltation.

And we see glory used in both ways here.

Uh, first we see that Jesus says, glorify your son, that the son may glorify you.

So Jesus is asking and saying the hour has come for he to, for him to be exalted on the cross.

Then later in verse four, Jesus will say, I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.

Jesus's works glorified and praised, praised, uh, the son.

Can you see this right here that I underline?

Right?

You can see that.

Great, great, great, great, great.

So Jesus works a glorified or praise someone for their high and exalted status.

So the work of Christ glorified God in his exalted status.

And then in verse five, he says, and now father glorify me in your, in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.

So Jesus saying, uh, return me to the state I was before I came to earth.

So back to the state of glory and exaltation that he was in before he came as a wheel ill baby.

That's what Jesus is saying.

And so here in this, these few verses, we see the, the glory of God for his, his actions and the glory that will come from, from his actions, two different kinds of glory.

So a little glory edum, edumacation for you.

Um, okay.

We jumped around a few verses there.

So let's, let's jump back to the top.

Um, verse one, when Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, father, the hour has come and glorify your son so that the son may glorify you.

Since you have given him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom you have given him.

So God gave Jesus authority over all flesh, over all men to give eternal life to all who have been given to Jesus by the father.

Well, what does he give them eternal life?

So what is eternal life?

Verse three tells us this is eternal life that they know you, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.

Eternal life is knowing the only true God and knowing Jesus was sent by God.

That is eternal life, knowing God.

That's what Jesus says.

And this is eternal life that they know you, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.

Then Jesus says in verse four, I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.

He hasn't yet taken up the cross, but he knows, he knows what's coming.

He knows what's next.

Again, these are moments before, uh, they're about to go to, uh, the garden.

Judas is going to come going to kiss him on the cheek.

The officers are going to come and arrest him.

This is moments before this.

So he goes, we're here.

It's accomplished.

I know what is before me.

I know what is ahead of me and I'm going to do it.

It's accomplished.

It's, it's a done deal.

Verse five.

And now father glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed. this work that God sent Jesus to accomplish.

It is accomplished.

And when it's done, what he desires so bad is to be reunited with the father.

And guess what?

God answered his prayer.

Because that's where he is now until he comes back.

Come Lord Jesus.

The question I want to ask us today is what does it mean to know God?

What does it mean to know God?

This is what Jesus prayed specifically.

He's praying for his disciples, right?

Like it's littered all throughout the chapter that we just read.

If you don't believe me here, I'll read verse 20 to you.

Oh, I guess, sorry.

It's, it's littered all throughout, but he also includes us in that, right?

Verse 20 says, I do not ask for these only.

So for his disciples, his apostles, but also for those who will, who will believe in me through their word.

So all those who would believe through the words of the apostles, through the writings of the apostles, that's what Jesus is praying, not just for his apostles, that they would know God and believe in God, but that for all who would come to believe in God, us, even in this room today, that we would know God through their word.

I just told you the answer.

How do we know God?

If Jesus prayed that we would know him, the answer is right there in verse 20.

We know Jesus through the writings of the apostles.

We know Jesus through scripture.

Through the word.

That's how we know God.

Through the word.

So the first question I have, are you reading it?

Are you saturating yourself in the scriptures? scriptures?

Um, we've started doing this thing at my house and it's something that I, I've become very passionate about even to the point of, uh, I've been, I've been, I've been thinking about this a lot.

Um, and I, it's not, I didn't come up with it on my own.

So, um, take it or leave it.

Um, but we've started implementing this thing in our house and we, we call it, it's just family church.

And literally it's our family.

We pray all together.

Even with Jaden, he's there.

He's usually not participating.

He's, he's usually a distraction, but he's there.

We go over the catechism.

Uh, we read a Bible story from the children's Bible.

Know your audience.

And then we sing.

I am convinced that doing this with your family, whatever your family looks like in your house. is far more important than you having a daily devotional time by yourself.

I am convinced of that.

Let me tell you why.

And let me tell you why it's important to start now.

When our children start asking questions, not like, what's your favorite color?

Not like, is our dog going to be in heaven?

Not stupid questions like that.

When our kids start asking, Hey, how come my friend who's a girl has a, has a girlfriend?

What's, what's going on with that?

Hey, how come I see this in culture?

Hey, how come I see that in culture?

You will already have an open and, uh, fertile soil to impart truth into them.

Why?

Because you're already spending time doing this.

And so as they get older and you can actually start reading real Bible stories, not that these are fake.

Come on.

You know what I mean by that though.

You will already be in a habit and pattern of turning to the word.

Kayla asked me this question and I think she got it from somewhere else.

So again, we're all stealing from the best.

She asked, how can we teach our children to read?

And I was like, I don't know if they can read.

And then she was like, so they can read the scripture.

What's the purpose so that they can read?

Not so that they can go read Dr.

Seuss or Harry Potter or whatever, but so that they can know the scriptures.

What's the purpose of your family so that your children would know Christ?

Want me to throw some Bible on it?

I will gladly.

Deuteronomy chapter six.

We're going back to the law people.

Deuteronomy chapter six.

Verse four.

You're going to recognize this.

Hero Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is one.

You shall love the Lord, your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your might.

And these are the words that I command you to today shall be on your heart.

Verse seven.

Get ready.

You shall teach them diligently to your children.

We love quoting that verse.

Love the Lord, your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.

But if we continue on, what does the Lord, our God, the Lord, our God is one to tell us to do.

You shall teach them diligently to your children and shall talk to them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise.

You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.

You shall write them on your doorposts, on your house, and on your gates.

Guess what, husband?

Guess what, dad?

This is your responsibility.

This is not your wife's responsibility.

I go away one week and I'm fired up, y'all.

This is your responsibility to teach your children.

Do you have to have all the right answers?

Did your parents do this with you?

No.

But I think you're in this room not because you want what your parents gave you, but because you want what the Lord has for you.

So step up and do this for your family.

Amen.

If you need help, just ask.

The only time Sunday shouldn't be the only time your children hear prayer and it shouldn't just be meals.

Sunday shouldn't be the only time that we go over catechism.

Why?

Because this isn't just filler for our children.

This is teaching them doctrine.

That they would know what Christ's death means for us.

That because of Christ's death, our sins are no more.

This right here, this is, this is, these catechisms, these are layups.

These are freebies.

These are, these are easy.

And we just have to reinforce.

I'm telling you.

Implement this into your house.

Let this be the thing that you spend more time over.

And I, I promise you, you will start to see a difference.

I know it's hard.

I know you've got work.

I know you've got a ton on your plate.

I know you're stressed about all these things.

But it is our jobs as the heads of our households to teach our children to show them what it looks like to know God.

That wasn't in my notes.

That was just extra for you.

Okay.

What does it mean to know God?

Scripture.

Through his word.

How else do we know God?

That word know is an action.

It's a verb.

In that sentence that we would know God, it's, it's a, it's a verb.

It requires action.

Knowing God is not just knowing stories or commands.

Knowing God is not just knowing stories or commands because knowing commands and doing commands are two different things.

I know the speed limit is 65, but I'm really good at 70.

I know at a yellow light usually it means to slow down.

But I'm really good at speeding up.

Knowing commands and doing them are two different things.

Let me read for us Romans 1 chapter, chapter 1 verse 18 through 21.

It says, for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.

For what can be known about God is plain to them because God has shown it to them.

For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made.

So they are without excuse.

Then verse 21 tells us, for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened.

For although they knew God they did not honor him as God.

Whew.

That sentence should send chills down our spine.

They knew God.

They did not honor him as God or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened.

Is that you my friend?

Do you know God and yet your foolish heart has been darkened?

Not my words.

These are Paul's.

Get mad at him.

Not me.

To know God is to obey God.

To know God is to obey God.

What is the example that Jesus gives us and what what is he saying in these first five verses?

Jesus glorified God on earth by accomplishing the work that he gave him to do and because of that finished work Jesus is reunited with God and in the midst of this what does Jesus pray for us to do?

To know God and obey God.

This last weekend we were while we were in San Diego we went and visited a friend of my church we used to be on staff at the same church he left that church and he became a pastor of another church and it was just a beautiful church and he's a pastor and a teacher that I just I really look up to and admire and he shared this acronym SIMBA SIMBA and that I think is helpful sometimes for these like super kind of like sometimes might feel ethereal right to know God like yeah know God yeah know God just know God you know and this acronym I think it's really helpful for when we have these ideas that kind of seem big but yet seem very simple and and so I wanted to share that with you but but before I wanted to remind you of of SIMBA and I asked chat GPT for a summary of the lion king because I just thought it would be funny and so let me read it to you and I just it's great the lion king tells the story of Simba a young lion prince destined to rule the pride lands now I'm going to add to this because I just can't wait to be king right well after the death of his father Mufasa Simba is manipulated into believing that he is to blame for his father's death and runs away he grows up far from home trying to forget his past and a carefree life with new friends hakuna matata what a wonderful phrase but as darkness falls over his kingdom under the rule of his treacherous uncle scar Simba must confront his guilt reclaim his rightful place as king and restore balance his journey shows us that no matter how far you run you can't run away from who you are you can't run away from who you are that's the whole idea of this Simba acronym Simba right you see it there oh S I M B A Simba saved once I become saved what does that mean I am a new creation I have a new identity I have a new identity and since I am a new person what does that mean I need to be transformed by the renewing of my mind as Paul will tell us in Romans and since I have a new mind that means I need to take up new behaviors and now that I have new behaviors I have new affections the things that I desire and long for change and it all starts because I am saved by grace through faith you see when we are in Christ we cannot run from who we are you cannot run from who you are Christian because you are in Christ you have a new identity so the question I want to ask and we apply this with Simba let's think about it in regards to knowing God because I know God I'm saved I've been given eternal life cool what does that mean with my identity it means I am a child of God I have been adopted into his family I have been adopted into his family so how does that identity how does that affect my mind it means I no longer have to earn my standing with God I don't have because I know God I no longer have to earn my standing with God I don't do things with God for God to get something in return and my mind needs to be changed in that because everything else in this world we try to earn it you earn that promotion you earn that upgrade you earn that new car you earn that trip you earn this you earn that you earn this and everything about the gospel so we didn't earn it and we need to get that through our thick skulls that I have been transformed by the renewing of my mind and that renewal started with salvation and then it makes its way into our behaviors I do what he commands because he's a loving father he knows better than me just this morning I was in the back of the kitchen over here I was washing dishes Jaden was back there and there's a water container and water jug back there and if you press the blue one guess what water comes out so Jaden did it once I didn't see it he did it twice he chuckled turn around and I see water and I go oh boy he does it a third time smack his hand does it a fourth time I smack his hand does it a fifth time he finally gets it and he's crying he's sad and he's upset but one I don't want his clothes to be wet two I don't want a big mess three I don't want to pick it up I try my best to be a loving father who loves his kids and our heavenly father he loves us and he's given us his commands not as a burden but as a blessing so that we would know him so we would know his heart know that he loves us so much that he doesn't want to leave us the way we are that's why he has given us his spirit to empower us to sanctify us to become more like him you've been saved you have a new identity you are a child of god remember that you no longer have to earn your standing with god remember that he gives us his commands because he loves us in our heart we we so desire what he desires i want what he wants i want what god wants because his way is better because i've seen what happens when i run my life it's not very good i want my heart to be aligned with his will where do i learn his will where do i learn his commands his word and so i steep myself in his word not just for myself not just so that when my kids wake up and they come from downstairs they see their daddy with an open bible at the coffee table oh look at me i'm so good no i invite my children in to learn about jesus with me i invite my family into learning about jesus with me and this isn't like i wish i would have learned this long before kayla and i had kids not that we were married very long before we had kids but that's neither here nor there but if we would have started this together oh man i wonder how that would have changed our our marriage and we're doing this together it's not our separate faiths and then we come together no we're under one house we're learning together we're saturating ourselves in the truth together we're okay i gotta stop i beat a dead horse preach it because i know god i've been given eternal life i am a child of god and so i no longer have to earn my standing with god and i do what he commands because he is a loving father and i want what he wants because his way is better and because he loved me first he loved me first would you pray with me jesus we thank you for your word and father i ask and i pray holy spirit would you convict us of not my own convictions but of what you have for each and every one of us father convict us of the truth your word is truth we love you we thank you father it's in jesus name everyone said amen amen
