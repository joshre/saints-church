## Transcription

Well, good morning and Merry Christmas .

This morning, we are taking a break from Acts to look at the Christmas story and what a fun time to study it's been for me this week, and so let's just jump right in.

I heard a quote the other day from, actually I read it, from an obituary of all places, and it said that the person who had just died was going from the land of the dying to the land of the living.

Let me say that again, give you a moment to kind of process that.

This person who just died, it was said of them that they were going from the land of the dying to the land of the living.

It's an incredibly profound statement, and if you're a Christian, it's the truth.

We are dying.

The world around us is dying.

Everything is dying and perishing, and it's been that way since page 3.

Chapter 3 in Genesis, where we see Adam and Eve eat of the fruit, and of course the serpent questions them and says, Are you sure you'll die?

Are you sure we won't die?

And then what happens?

There is, well, physical death enters the world as well as spiritual death, a separation, and a divide between God and man.

And the story we see in Scripture, the promises made by God to His people, and the reality of who Jesus is and what He's done and accomplished, is about restoring creation from death back to life.

And so, this morning, as we look at Luke chapter 2, and take a moment to read Luke's account of the birth of Jesus, we get to see, again, how God continues to bring life from death, a death that we've brought upon ourselves.

So, let's turn to Luke chapter 2, this morning, as we read our Bible, turn to Acts, that's crazy.

Luke chapter 2, starting in verses 1 and 3, it says, Where is it?

In those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be registered.

This was the first generation when Quinerius was governor of Syria, and all went to be registered, each to his own town.

And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David.

But, I was just supposed to read the three verses, and I got carried away reading the fourth.

So, Luke starts his account of the birth of Jesus.

Well, there's actually some stuff that happens in chapter 1, but the actual birthing of Jesus.

He starts his account with historical fact.

And Luke is clearly showing and saying that, no, this is, like, legit.

Like, we can look at this in history, right?

He says, a decree coming out from Caesar Augustus, that all should be registered.

So, when we talk about Jesus, we're not just talking about this ancient myth, or this cute story of the past, or this just, Mary had a baby, yes, Lord.

We're not just, yes, she did.

And yes, that did actually happen.

This isn't just a sweet fairy tale.

No, we can be sure that Jesus was, and is, a real person.

And he was born in the days of the first registration, when Quirinius was governor of Syria.

Jesus' birth begins in the real world with real history.

That's what Luke is saying here in these first three verses.

Now, verse 4 continues.

And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judah, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.

So, Luke checks the history box.

And now, if we were ingrained in the Old Testament, we would recognize a couple of important prophecies and covenants in the Old Testament.

So, it says, of the house of David and the lineage of David, which God promises to David in 2 Samuel, he says in verse 12, when your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your father, so when he dies, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.

So, God is promising to David that there is going to be someone in his descendants who he will establish his kingdom.

And if we were to read in 2 Samuel chapter 7, just a few verses down in verse 16, this promise ends with, your throne shall be established forever.

Forever.

So, we see this covenant that God makes with David.

He's from the house and the lineage of David.

And then, in the prophets, we see Micah 5 too.

But you, O Bethlehem, Ephrath, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me, one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.

So, Luke is saying here with these little hints that this is a special baby.

This isn't just an ordinary baby.

He is the one Israel has been anticipating.

Okay, let's jump back to Luke, verses 6 and 7.

So, Mary and Joseph, they make it to Bethlehem, of course, and the time came for Mary to give birth.

And he's in swatting cloths, laid in a manger, because there was no room in the inn.

Which, I feel like this is kind of a breezed by section and phrase.

Like, this wasn't like a Motel 6.

This wasn't like that kind of situation.

It was most likely like some sort of, you know, family-run couple rooms in the house, and there were no rooms left in the place.

But also, how do you see a pregnant woman?

And not only just, like, give up a seat, but like, oh, no, you can have your room.

She's, you know, she's really, she's working on her breathing.

She's about to give birth.

Like, this is a pregnant woman we're talking about, people.

And this guy's like, hey, I've got a little barn out back.

You can, you can just go on back there.

Does anyone else not think that's crazy?

That's absolutely crazy.

And yet, we just, we think it's so cute with the little nativity, and there's the animals around, and then there's literally God in human flesh.

But like, for Luke, it's just kind of like a meh detail here.

I also think about how John the Baptist will later say about Jesus that he will say in the book of John, behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.

Does that mean here in this barn that Mary had a little lamb?

Some of you guys, everyone, just right over your head.

Whatever.

Verse 8.

And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping over their flock by night.

And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear.

And the angel said to him, Fear not, for behold, I bring to you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior who is Christ the Lord.

And this will be a sign for you.

You will find a baby wrapped in swatting cloths, lying in a manger.

So, while Jesus is being born, there are some shepherds doing what shepherds do, being with sheep.

And which, like, this was not an esteemed job.

This was not like, you know, you don't have to go to college for this job.

This is not, like, a very popular job.

Like, kids aren't waking up and growing up when they're asked, What do you want to be when you grow up?

I want to be a shepherd.

Like, nobody grows up and is like, I want to work at McDonald's.

Maybe some people do.

I don't know.

I love some fries.

But at any rate, these shepherds are working the graveyard shift, but an angel of the Lord appears to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they are afraid.

I would be too.

Because you imagine, maybe you're out one of these shepherds in the field, and you're, like, half awake, because it's midnight or whatever time in the middle of the night, and then all of a sudden, just like, boom, there's an angel.

And not just an angel, but the glory of the Lord shone around this angel.

That would cause fear.

But fear not, the angel says.

I'm bringing good news of great joy.

Good news of great joy.

When you think about Jesus, are you filled with great joy?

I think sometimes we can come to church, or we even just go about our day-to-day lives, and we miss out on the joy that Jesus brings.

Jesus is born, and these angels crash into the scene going, there's good news.

Hey, there's good news here, people.

And we Christians have the greatest news, the best news ever known to man.

And yet, what are we known for?

We're known for being hypocritical, not practicing what we preach, and I think we might have a little bit of a problem, and it starts with looking in the mirror and going, am I filled with great joy?

That's what Jesus brings, and I'm not saying you can't be sad, or life can't be hard sometimes, but I've got good news of great joy, and His name is Jesus.

And so my attitude, my outlook should reflect that.

So these angels report to the shepherd that the Savior is born, who is the Christ, or Messiah, meaning anointed one.

And if we were to look back, of course it's said multiple times here, this is the city of David.

If we were to look back on when David was anointed as king of Israel, it happened in Bethlehem.

And so these angels are saying, there's another anointed one in the city of David, in Bethlehem.

And here's how you'll find him.

A baby wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.

And verse 13 comes and says, And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom He is pleased.

So this one angel was bringing the good news, and then was surrounded by the multitude of heavenly hosts who were praising God.

And they were saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom He is pleased.

Glory to God for His Son, His only begotten Son.

Which, that word begotten, means to receive a nature.

So a person begets something that has the same nature as himself, but makes or creates something of a different nature.

So Jesus is the only begotten Son of God, meaning that Jesus is God in a different nature than God, because Jesus is a human man.

And because of this Son, there is peace on earth with those whom God is pleased.

Other translations of this verse say, Peace to men on whom His favor rests.

God's peace is given to those who are recipients of His good favor or goodwill.

So, verse 15, When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.

This is a lesson in salvation.

How is one saved?

Is it by you choosing Jesus?

Or, just like these shepherds, they heard the good news of Jesus by the Lord making Himself known to them.

That's what it tells us right here, which the Lord has made known to us.

As one saved by them choosing a relationship with God.

Or, just like these shepherds, they heard the good news of Jesus by the Lord making Himself known to them.

These shepherds would have been out in the field, business as usual, doing what they always would have done if it weren't for the Lord crashing into the scene.

We cannot save ourselves.

These shepherds wouldn't have known the mysterious and wonderful plan of the Lord if it weren't for the angels making the Lord known to them.

And the same goes for you and me.

If God has made Himself known to you, you received that gift of salvation.

Let's jump to verse 16.

And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the baby lying in a manger.

And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child.

And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them.

But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart.

And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen as it had been told to them.

So the shepherds received the good news.

And what did they do?

Just like sit on it.

Just kind of like hang out.

It's like, oh, that's cool.

No, they believed and then they went, it tells us, with haste.

There was a giddy up about them, a movement, a quickness about them on their way to investigate what they had just witnessed from the angels.

And sure enough, there's a little baby in a manger just like the angels told them.

And then what do they do?

They just go, oh yeah, that's cool.

Let's just head on back out to the sheep.

No, it tells us that they were telling anyone and everyone who heard about it.

Verse 17, and when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child and all who heard it.

So a lot of people heard it because they were telling people about it.

They wondered at what the shepherds told them.

Could you imagine being one of these people who heard these shepherds tell you this story?

Yeah, so we were just out there in the field watching the sheep. and then an angel showed up and then they told us about this baby and then there was like these heavenly hosts and like dude, it was crazy.

They started like praising and worshiping and like glorifying.

Oh God, it was crazy.

And so then we went to go see if there was a baby and then there was the baby.

And they said he's the Messiah.

The Christ.

Isn't that crazy?

You'd probably be like these guys have been hanging with the sheep for a little too long.

What is going on here?

As I begin to land the plane here I just want to ask who in your life are you sharing the good news with?

Is there anyone in your life you are sharing the good news with?

There was nothing special about these shepherds.

They were doing nothing.

They just were some no-name guys and yet God made himself known to them.

And if God has made himself known to you then the only proper response is glorifying and praising God and going around talking about Jesus.

That's the only proper response.

Why?

Because obedience. obedience.

That's what the Lord tells us to do.

I mean we've been in the book of Acts and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and to the ends of the earth.

And if you are a Christian if you are a believer then our job and role is to be witnesses.

And so are you being obedient to what God has called all Christians to be?

No matter how crazy your story might be or how boring you think your story might be God has made himself known to you.

And that's good news.

Are you talking about it?

I mentioned that quote from the obituary about the man how he passed from the land of the dying to the land of the living and we are all dying.

Everything around us is dying.

The wages of sin is death and the effects of sin do not just impact us but all of creation is dying because of sin.

And God sent his son into the land of the dying.

He sent a baby who would grow in wisdom and stature.

He was patient at just the right time.

He let thousands of years of humanity and life and things happen before Christ and here we are thousands of years later still looking back at Christ and he didn't just send a 30 year old savior.

He let him grow into the man that he would become and yet he did not sin but he would grow to live a perfect life and then he would die a sinner's death so that any sinner could take up his righteousness take up Jesus' righteousness as their own.

God did all that for his most treasured creation.

God did all of that to get rid of death.

Could there have been other ways?

Sure.

But that's not God's way and I'm grateful for his plan and his providence and for the miracle of God coming to earth in the form of a baby humbling himself to the form of a baby who would grow up to save the world and also save me.

I want us to end this morning by singing that bridge again from O Come All You Faithful and I would challenge you and ask you and invite you to just respond by adoring the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords and the Prince of Peace how Jesus became our peace Jesus is our peace so that we could be reunited with God yet again that his presence could be in us through the gift of his spirit. can we just take these next few minutes and moments and just adore our Lord and Savior would you pray with me?

Jesus we thank you that you are a real man that you really came to earth that you really lived a perfect life that you really died a sinner's death the weight of my sin the weight of all sin fell upon your shoulders and you became the final sacrifice the perfect sacrifice so that I could come to new life God thank you for making me alive thank you for saving me from death Lord would you help me would you help us to be like these shepherds who went around sharing the good news of what you have done for them what you have made known to them Lord we adore you and we just want to worship you so we thank you for the opportunity to do that this morning we love you and it's in Jesus name everyone say amen come on let's stand and worship the Lord sing that again oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore for him Christ the Lord for he alone is worthy for he alone is worthy for he alone is worthy Christ the Lord we give you all the glory we give you all the glory we give you all the glory Christ the Lord we give we give you all the glory we give you all the glory we give you all the glory we give you all the glory Christ the Lord we give you all the glory Christ the Lord the glory we give you all the glory we give you all the glory we give you all the glory we give you all the glory we give you all the glory we give you all the glory we give you all for all that you have done for us by sending your son and this Christmas season may we be filled with gratitude and thankfulness of all that you have done to save us may we not keep and hold on to that message ourselves but may we share it because if it weren't for you where would we be so that's why we can give you all the glory and give you all the praise because you are the only one who is worthy of the glory thank you for that truth thank you for saving us we thank you for knowing us we love you lord and are so grateful for sending your son what a gift what a joy we love you lord pray these things in your name everyone said amen
