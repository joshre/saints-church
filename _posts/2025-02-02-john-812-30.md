## Transcription

All right this morning before we jump in a few announcements.

First our dinner party is this week at the Reader Esparza's.

Just remember hope that's in your calendar.

Another calendar thing which is kind of exciting.

Save the date we are actually doing a VBS this summer for the kiddos and that'll be July 21st through 25th and there's gonna be a lot more information dropping in Slack soon so be prepared for that.

July 21 through 25 VBS.

I'm looking forward to it it's gonna be awesome.

And then one last thing of note a few weeks ago I sort of announced some sort of different things and for lack of a better term church goals if you will.

Although I don't I don't like that name I'm just gonna say that I don't like church goals it feels weird feels corporate.

Anyways that's neither here nor there don't get me on that rant.

I talked about the sort of challenge of one family every month and I wanted to add another level of clarification just because from if we make that our focus the it can turn into some at least I imagine it can turn into some competition but not in a good way competition in comparison and that's not what we want from this and so we're spinning it on its head a little bit and really the goal is well what I'll ask is that you would pray for God to reveal a specific specific person or a couple that you can begin praying for for the purpose of just building relationship no strings attached because what can happen is and I've experienced this in my own life when I have this expectation whether it be not said to them but you have this expectation no I want to get this person to church you know whatever might be it just doesn't it's not as natural it's not as normal it's not as authentic and so what I would ask is that we would just begin praying for these people whether you know their name or not whether you have a person in mind whether you yeah whether they know Jesus or not just that we would begin to pray for a specific person or a specific couple or someone that you can build relationship with and I mentioned this couple before and I'll mention them again there's this couple in our neighborhood and I have not met them yet I've said I've done the nice wave high thing as they're walking their dog I don't know their names I don't know if they have kids I don't even know if they're married they looked married because they were walking a dog together and but I mean I don't I don't know and I saw them walking their dog yet again this last week and have I been kind of stalking them on my doorbell camera maybe but that's neither here nor there um anyways I have begun praying for this couple and I don't know their names yet I don't know their information yet like but God put them on my heart as I was thinking and praying for people that God would put on my heart this is the couple that God put on my heart Kayla has some other people on her heart and so we're we're talking about it we're praying for them just specifically for the purpose of building relationship and what God does with that relationship like I I don't know but I want this to be a place I want whether it be a dinner party or you know a prayer and worship gathering or Sunday as we're talking like I want I would love to see us like come in and sharing the news of like no I got their name I know their name now I'm praying them by name now like or we exchange information or like I I didn't just see them on the doorbell camera I actually like went out to the mailbox even though I knew the mailman didn't come yet but like I I created I stepped out to to meet them I I got my barista's name like you know little things like that whatever and but simply for the purpose of building relationship that we would be people who seek out other people Zacchaeus was a wee little man and a wee little man was he right Jesus sought after him and not saying you have to go to a tax collector not saying you have to call up the IRS I hope you're not listening but yeah Jesus um but anyways that just so clarification on that is who are you praying for and yeah just pray that God would begin to soften your heart towards them and that you would yeah begin to build a relationship with them and if they come to church great if they don't great keep building relationship Capiche sweet in fact let's pray right now and then we'll jump into John chapter 8 Jesus we thank you for who you are we thank you that you have put us in our specific neighborhoods you've put us at our specific workplaces you've put us in different capacities different parks different shoot grocery stores even to run into people and I pray as we step into these places God we wouldn't be weird about it we wouldn't be awkward but God we would know that we are your ambassadors we are your spokespeople to the world and God I pray that we would seek out other people in our neighborhoods in wherever we are and that we would just begin to pray for them whether they know it or not whether we know their names or not God that doesn't matter because you do and you know all of my thoughts even before I have thought them and so yeah we just pray that even right now this couple that I don't know yeah that you would create opportunities for Kail and I to connect with them and to get to know them and yeah we just pray that all of us you would put a person a couple multiple people in our minds that we would seek out for the purpose of building relationship for the purpose of just being a light as you were a light and so we love you we praise you and it's in your name everyone said amen let's turn to John chapter 8 we're gonna read the remainder of the chapter the remainder of the chapter this morning John 8 starting verse 12 and then we'll read through 59 there's a bunch of great stuff in here we're gonna get through about half of it today and then we'll pick it up next week but John 8 verse 12 1 2 ready go if somebody wants to read it thanks yes going but you do not know where I come from or where I am going you judge according to the flesh I judge no one yet even if I do judge my judgment is true for it is not I alone who judged but I am the father who sent me in your law it is written that the testimony of two people is true I am the one who bears witness about myself and the father who sent me bears witness about me they said to him therefore where is your father she's the same third you know neither me nor my father if you knew me you would know my father also these words he spoke in the Treasury as he taught in the temple but no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come so he said to them again I'm going away and you will seek me and you will die in your sin where I'm going you cannot come so the Jews said will he kill himself since he says where I'm going you cannot come he said to them you are from below I am from above you are of this world I told you that you would die in your sins for unless you believe that I am he who will die in your sin so they said to him who are you Jesus said to them just what I have been telling you from the beginning I have much to say about you and much to judge but he who sent me is true and I declared to the world what I did not understand that he had been speaking about the father so Jesus said to them when you have lifted up the Son of man and he will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own before you but speak just as the father taught me and he who sent me is with me he has not left me alone for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.

As you were saying these things many believed in him so Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him if you abide in my word you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free they answered him we are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone how is it that you say you will become free Jesus answered them truly truly I say to you everyone who practices saying is a slave to sin the slave does not remain in the house forever the son remains forever so if the son sets you free you will be free indeed I know that you're offspring of Abraham yet you seek to come me because my word finds no place in you I speak of what I have seen with my father and you do what you have they answered him Abraham is our father Jesus said to them if you were Abraham's children you would be doing the works Abraham did but now you seek to kill me a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God this is not what Abraham did you were doing the works your father did they said to him we are not born of sexual immorality we have one father even God Jesus said to them if God were your father you would love me for I came from God and I am here I came not of my own accord but he sent me why do you not understand what I say and it is because you cannot bear to hear my word you are of your father the devil and your will is to do your father's desires he was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him when he lies he speaks out of his own character for he is a liar and the father of lies but because I tell you the truth you do not believe me which one of you convinced me if I tell you the truth why do you not believe me whoever is of God hears the words of God the reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God the Jews answered him are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon Jesus answered I do not have a demon but I honor my father and you dishonor me and I do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge truly truly I say to you if anyone keeps my word he will never see that but you said to him now we know that you have a demon Abraham died as did the prophets yet you say if anyone keeps my word he will never face death are you greater than our father Abraham who died and the prophets died who do you make yourself out to be if I glorify myself my glory is nothing it is my father who glorifies me of whom you say he is our God but you have not known him I know him if I were to say that I do not know him I would be a liar like you but I do know him and I keep his word your father Abraham was joyous but he would see my day he saw it was glad so the Jews said to him you are not yet 50 years old and have you seen Abraham Jesus said to them truly truly I say to you before Abraham was I am so they picked up stones to throw them but Jesus hit himself and went out of the temple.

This chapter is fire there's like so many coffee mugs in this in this chapter right like you will know the truth and the truth will set you free seen that on a coffee cup before if the Sun set you free you will be free indeed and it's like you read it in context you're like that coffee cup can go in the trash anyway so let's get to the start of this chapter we can tell we're starting to get closer and closer to the end of John because Jesus is speaking a whole lot more directly he's coming straight at him straight for the jugular and it all starts with again Jesus spoke to them saying verse 12 I am the light of the world another I am statement beautiful and he Jesus says I'm the light of the world whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life it's funny we're talking about creation with the kiddos and we see this I am the light of the world right God spoke light into existence and then even later on it the I am from above you are from below we see in day two of the creation God sets the heavens above and the earth below and so anyways so I as we're going through that I'm like seeing I'm like oh yeah yeah creation cool stuff anyways so Jesus obviously is saying I am light so if Jesus is light then sin would be darkness right Jesus is not of sin Jesus is God Jesus is perfect and the opposite of light is dark and darkness bad dark is sin Paul would later write the wages of sin is death darkness death is dark whoever follows Jesus he says will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life to steal from my good old pals DC talk I want to be in the light as he is in the light I want to shine shine like the stars in heavens but the Pharisees have a problem with Jesus testifying about himself and we'll get into a little bit more of that later because it gets there but verse 13 so the Pharisees said to him you are bearing witness about yourself your testimony is not true this is like a few chapters ago I believe it's chapter 5 where Jesus gives witness of he says you know the father testified about me John testified about me the prophets testified about me you know all these different and my works testify about me that's what Jesus said I believe it's John chapter 5 and so here we are again and this is the the words used here the language used here is not just like a normal conversation like they're like grilling him like he's like in court on the stand these are sort of legal terms that they're that they're using here saying your testimony is not true and so we got it we kind of have to keep that in mind as we think about this whole context here and the Pharisees are clearly upset that Jesus is testifying about themselves and this is a break of the law he's breaking Mosaic law so they think and this also kind of reminds me of I don't know if you've seen because they're clearly calling Jesus a a false witness Jesus is wrongly or is Jesus they think Jesus is wrongly testifying about who he is and you might have seen this on a bumper sticker or cheesy Instagram page or again a coffee mug this phrase God said it I believe it that settles it you know never seen that before God said it I believe it that settles it and that's wrong and the Pharisees are essentially that bumper sticker God said it Jesus said it they're having a problem with the I believe it and Jesus goes well that settles it and you see the problem with the problem with the Pharisees here is you don't have to believe it for it to be true if God said it that settles it Jesus is saying I am the light of the world period that settles it he you don't have to believe it for it to be true and so if God says it that settles it whether you believe it or not is your own prerogative but your belief does not change the truth of God so Jesus answered them even if I do bear witness about myself my testimony is true for I know where I came from and where I am going but you do not know where I come from or where I am going Jesus essentially is saying even if I bear witness about myself it's true because I know who I am I know where I come where I came from and I know where I'm going now I think this is something for us to note here this whole I know who I am right that's essentially what Jesus is saying I know who I am it's you Pharisees you are the ones who are having an issue with me I do not have an issue with you well I do have an issue with you you don't believe me but I know who I am and I think it's incredibly important at our current cultural context to speak to this a little bit because I think people all the time and not not unbelievers because as Jesus just told us they are in darkness they are not in the light whoever follows Jesus is in the light so we're leaving unbelievers out of this but for the believer we have to be very careful because we can take Jesus's words and in I will paraphrase Jesus's words essentially saying I know who I am right I know where I came from I know where I am going but you do not know where I come from or where I'm going Jesus's words there I know where I came from and where I'm going I know who I am I am Jesus I am the light of the world as he says later in this chapter before Abraham was I am Jesus knows who he is and we have to be very careful because we can take that concept those words that idea and apply them to ourselves and our lives and that is dangerous first because we are not Jesus and we can take on this I know who I am mentality like Jesus especially being a Christian we are not Jesus we are from Adam meaning we are from sin how does this look like in the real life it looks like a couple after years of marriage saying ah we we drifted apart we're different people now instead of standing in the gap instead of pursuing Jesus and pursuing this union and covenant that you made before God and man of staying together you're calling it quits obviously this is a very blanket stroke there's we're not going to get into the specifics it can look like that I'm not saying exclusively can also look like I know who I am and so I'm gonna start a same sex relationship and think it's biblical and God honoring which scripture has other things to say about that and we must be careful and remember who we are we are in sin and only through Jesus do we step into the light okay that's an antidote I will get off my soapbox and get back to the text verse 15 you judge according to the flesh I judge no one yet even if I do judge my judgment is true for it is not I alone who judge but I and the Father who sent me Jesus is not the judge in his earthly ministry but Jesus does reveal he does separate right like even in this text we see the Jews and the Pharisees they start picking up stones at the end of this chapter we also see those who would believe in him so he separates but Jesus came to earth to save us not judge us but even if he did judge it would be with right judgment since Jesus came from the Father verse 17 it is written in your law that the testimony of two people is true I am the one who bears witness about myself and the Father who sent me bears witness about me I think this is sort of the crux of the argument here because Jesus they they bring up the law and which is their whole reason for saying that his testimony is not true and Jesus takes the law and flips it back at them and the part of the law that they're referencing is numbers 35 through 30 which has the context of murder and as the context of death but I'll just read the part that is kind of the where they're getting their statement they say but numbers 35 30 says but no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness such as saying if there's two witnesses then that testimony is true you can't just say this person murdered another person if there wasn't another person to see it if there wasn't another person to vouch for that statement so and what does Jesus say I have born witness about myself but also the Father born witness about me and of course he's referring to his baptism this is my son who I love and which I'm well pleased so there were two witnesses and we already mentioned again John chapter 5 his works as well as so his miracles as well as the testimony of John the Baptist behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world okay they said to him therefore verse 19 where is your father Jesus answered you know neither me nor my father if you knew me you would know my father also Pharisees are essentially saying where's your daddy boy but in all seriousness we need to remember the sort of context this is really a no-brainer for us right we know Jesus is God we we know it when Jesus says my father we know he's referring to the Lord and the Pharisees and Jews when Jesus says my father they think he's talking about Joseph and so this could probably be a legitimate question right who's your who's your dad and we see a theme of this throughout John where the people are asking a question in the natural and Jesus in turn responds in the spiritual right and Jesus essentially says to them you don't know me or my father I personally think and I mean we see this later on in the in the chapter but Jesus is convicting them of not of misreading the Torah they misread the scriptures Jesus is essentially saying if you knew me you would know my father the opposite applies if you knew the father you would also know me you would believe in me but he Jesus doesn't stop there he said to them verse 21 I am going away and you will seek me and you will die in your sin where I am going you cannot come think about his audience he's standing in the temple specifically tells us in the Treasury wherever that was we don't know but they did and Jesus says to them where I'm going you cannot come you will die in your sin lost my spot there we go and we'll get more clarity on this in John 14 when Jesus says I'm the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father but through me right Jesus is essentially saying that same sort of here where where I am going you cannot come you will seek me you will look for me and you will not find me and you will die in your sin that's crazy he's talking to the Jewish leaders and he's telling them you're gonna you're gonna die in your sin because you missed me because I am the way I am the truth I am the life Jesus said it here in this text whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life if you don't follow Jesus you don't get the light of life verse 22 so the Jews said will he kill himself since he says where I am going you cannot come Jesus said to them you are from below I am from above you are of this world I am NOT of this world I told you that you would die in your sins for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins so clearly there's some confusion among the Jews and Jesus clarifies what he's going to do I'm going to die for your sins Jesus says I told you that you would die in your sins for unless you believe that I am he who will die in your sins essentially you will die in sin if you do not believe Jesus died for your sins you will die in your sin if you do not believe Jesus died for your sins 25 so Jesus said to them who are you they said to him sorry who are you Jesus said to them just what I have been telling you from the beginning I have much to say about you and much to judge but he who sent me is true and I declare to the world what I have heard from him they did not understand that he had been speaking to them about the father so Jesus said to them when you have lifted up the Son of Man then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak just as the father taught me and he who sent me is with me he has not left me alone for I always do the things that are pleasing to him as he was saying these things many believed in Jesus the Jews ask who are you and Jesus lays it out even more clearly and then Jesus tells the crowd he's going to be lifted up and of course these good Jews who are in the temple when Jesus says these words the Son of Man will be lifted up they would have a flashback to numbers 21 when Moses lifted up the bronze serpent and he lifts up the servant and serpent and those who were bitten by the serpent would be saved from the judgment of God the good and right judgment of God and Jesus here says when the Son of Man will be lifted up sorry I lost my spot then you will know that I am he that I am the one who's what I said about me is true you will look upon me as I am lifted up and I will be the Savior when the judgment of God is upon you sin and you look to me to be your healer but more importantly your Savior what's the result of this many believed in Jesus Jesus saying I'm the light of the world you're gonna die in your sin unless you believe in me and I will die for your sins this will make sense when I am lifted up and of course when Jesus says I will be lifted up he's referring to the cross to save those who will hear and believe that Jesus is the Christ that Jesus is the Savior of the world that Jesus came to die for our sins so that we do not have to die in our sin let me take us back to the whole point of John's Gospel John 20 31 says but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that by believing you may have life in his name some of the people in this treasury at the temple did not believe the words of Jesus but some did some believed that Jesus was and is a Savior of the world and this whole book of John is written so that we might believe that Jesus is Christ the Son of God and that by believing we might have life in his name let's close and pray together Jesus we thank you for who you are we thank you for being the sacrifice for our sins we thank you for being the light of the world and father I pray as we go about our days go about our weeks go about our lives that we would constantly go back and remember who you are remember that it is in you and through you that we have life God help us to trust your word help us to walk in your truth and not our own help us to remember that you are the light of the world and that as we walk in the darkness of this world that through your spirit being in us and through us we are lights we are image bearers of you and beacons of hope to point people to you father we know that our ways are sinful our ways lead to destruction God in your ways lead to light and your ways lead to life Jesus may we walk in that light may we walk with you thank you for your word we thank you for your testimony that it is true and it's in Jesus name amen
