## Transcription

Well, Happy New Year, everyone!

Happy New Year!

This morning we turn to what I could argue is one of the more important chapters and texts in the Book of Acts, as well as maybe even the New Testament, we could argue.

And that is because this is the acceptance of uncircumcised Gentiles who have come to faith in Jesus into the fellowship of God's people.

So, Jesus' life, death, and resurrection is not just for the Jews, that is, the people of God, but to the Gentiles, which a Gentile is just somebody who is not Jewish, who is not of a Jewish faith and religion.

And if it weren't for that, truthfully, we would kind of be toast, or we'd have to convert to Judaism, or the promises of scriptures wouldn't quite be fulfilled.

And so it would just be a big problem if this weren't the fact, if this weren't the point, but it is.

Okay, so let's dive right in.

Acts 10, verse 1.

Okay, so Cornelius is a Roman officer who was in charge of this Italian cohort.

He was responsible for around 80 soldiers, this Cornelius guy was responsible for around 80 or so soldiers, and he would have been a Roman citizen, and like we talked about, a Gentile.

And Luke tells us that he is a devout man, right?

At the very beginning of verse 2, he was a devout man.

So he was religious, he was somewhat religious, he was devoted to, of course, he was known as a God-fearer, which a God-fearer to the Jews would have been someone who was not yet converted to Judaism, but would have worshipped and would have recognized and would have known the God of Israel.

And not only does it tell us he feared God, but with all of his household.

So he led his family to worship God, the Jewish God Yahweh, of course.

And it also says he gave alms generously.

So he offered a portion of his money, most likely to the Jewish temple or the synagogue where he was.

But it also could have been he was generous with his money to his fellow soldiers, to the fellow Greeks and people around him.

And it also tells us that he prayed continually to God.

So he was probably a consistent participant in regular prayer at these times.

And this isn't the point of this sermon, but I just got to ask, like, what are you going to be known for?

Here we get this telling of this guy, Cornelius, and he's known for being a devout man who feared God with all his household.

He gave alms generously and he prayed continually.

What are you going to be known for?

How will people remember you?

And of course, our aim is to look and be like Jesus.

But if people were saying these things about me, I'd be pretty stoked.

OK, let's continue on to verse three, where it says about the ninth hour of the day, he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, Cornelius.

And he stared at him in terror and said, What is it, Lord?

And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.

And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter.

He is lodging with one Simon a tanner whose house is by the sea.

When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him.

And having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.

OK, so the first thing we have to address here is that God initiates salvation to the Gentiles.

It was God who initiated this this the beginning of this plan.

God initiated this whole plan and process and it is started by God, which, of course, this is not a a new thought.

But one we have to remember is that God is sovereign.

He is over all.

And he is in control.

What does God say to him?

Essentially, in verse four, he says, I see you.

Your prayers.

Verse four tells us your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.

I see you.

I see your works.

I see the things that you're doing.

And this is not I see your works like you've earned your salvation.

Luke is repeating this repeatedly mentions Cornelius is piety or his good works.

And it's probably to bring the readers attention, because remember, this would have been written to most likely Jews.

And the thing that Luke is trying to bring to attention is that God sees the devotion of a Gentile as much as he sees the devotion of a Jew.

And this text does not suggest that Cornelius deserves God's grace as a result of his devotion and charity.

No, but Cornelius is brought near to the gospel of Jesus, not because of his past devotion to God as a pagan God fear, but because of his willingness to obey the instructions of the angel and because of his willingness to listen to Peter.

Verse nine continues.

The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray and he became hungry and wanted something to eat.

But while we were while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth.

In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.

So we just learned about Cornelius and all of his and his buddies that he sent to find Peter, the apostle Peter.

And what's Peter doing?

He is on a rooftop and he's sunbathing and he's waiting on a sandwich.

That's what Peter is doing.

He's on top of a roof.

And he's waiting on a sandwich.

Some people are making him a sandwich.

Sandwich sounds kind of good right now.

And while he's on top of this roof, he kind of falls into a trance.

It's like he's like half awake and half asleep.

And then he sees this vision of a big sheet.

Think like a big blanket.

Then there's all kinds of animals on this blanket and it covers the entire earth.

That's kind of a weird dream, huh?

Have you ever dreamed of that?

About animals on a blanket and they cover the earth?

It's crazy.

Verse 13.

Verse 13.

And there came a voice to him, rise, Peter, kill and eat.

But Peter said, by no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.

Which tells us that on this super big animal blanket, there must have been unclean animals.

What are unclean animals?

In the Old Testament, there would have been animals that would have been categorized as unclean.

And some of these unclean animals would have been camels, pigs, ravens, rock badgers, lizards, geckos.

These are some of the animals that in the Old Testament God says are unclean.

And Peter is like, no way.

I'm not eating these unclean animals, God.

I'm not going to do it.

Then verse 15.

And the voice came to him again and a second time.

What God has made clean, do not call common.

So this voice that Peter is talking to, and he says it's God, so let's believe him.

It says what God has made clean, do not call common.

Which is important to note here.

That the word for made clean that is used in this Greek translation is the same word that is used in the Septuagint, which is the Greek translation of the Old Testament.

The same word is used when it talks about a person going through the purification process with a priest to be declared clean.

That's the same word that's used in the Septuagint or the Old Testament translation, the Greek Old Testament translation.

That's the same word that Luke uses here when writing this.

So in other words, God is saying, I have made these things clean.

These things that I'm telling you to eat have gone through the purification process.

And all the bacon lovers said, Amen.

Verse 16.

Now, to me, this just feels like Peter.

He's stubborn.

He doesn't take no for an answer.

And so this back and forth, it happens three times.

And eventually Peter is somewhat persuaded.

Verse 17.

Now, while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood at the gate and called out to ask whether Simon, who was called Peter, was lodging there.

And while Peter, while Peter was pondering the vision, the spirit said to him, behold, three men are looking for you.

Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them.

OK, so this vision that Peter has is over and done with.

And Peter is the text tells us he's inwardly perplexed, tells us he was pondering the vision.

And all around that same time, finally, the men that Cornelius sent to go get the apostle Peter are knocking at the door or whatever.

And he's inwardly and he then the spirit tells him, hey, go down.

These people are here for you.

Crazy.

Verse 21.

And Peter went down to to the men and said, I am the one you are looking for.

What is the reason for your coming?

And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God fearing man who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.

So he invited them in to be his guests.

So the soldiers knock on the door.

They were looking for Simon Peter.

And then Simon Peter comes in and is like, hey, it's me.

And then Peter lets them in.

It must have been too late to travel back that night.

So they stay the night with Peter at Simon the Tanner's house.

Verse 23 continues.

The next day, he rose and went away with them.

And some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.

And on the following day, they entered Caesarea.

Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.

OK, so Peter, they left that next morning and Peter brings some of his fellow believers, some other brothers in the faith.

It's like, hey, come on, you're coming with me.

And verse 25.

When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him.

But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up, I too am a man.

So Cornelius has this worshipful response towards Peter, right?

He falls down on his knees and starts worshiping Peter.

And if we remember the last chapter, that maybe could be because Peter just raised this woman named Dorcas up from the dead.

Remember, she was dead and now she's alive.

And so maybe word had spread about poor Dorcas, who was raised from the dead.

And so maybe, you know, Cornelius is like, oh, like, who is this guy?

And so he falls down on his knees and worships him.

But Peter lifted him up and said, Hey, chill, bro.

Stand up, I too am a man.

Verse 27.

And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered and said to them, You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation.

But God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean.

So when I was sent for, I came without objection.

I asked then why you sent for me.

So Peter goes like, hey, you know, I should not be in your home or even really associate with you because you are a Gentile.

You are you are unclean.

In other words, in his home, in his house, there might be things that rituals or purification process or or the buying of certain things might not be done in a Jewish manner or or how the scriptures and whatever other Jewish kind of rituals were were part of cleanliness at the time.

And so even going into this Gentiles house would mean that Peter and these other Jews are susceptible to being unclean, to becoming unclean.

And then Peter goes like, but I've got this.

God gave me this vision that I should not call any person common or unclean.

So why did you send for me?

That's what Peter says.

And verse 30.

And Cornelius said four days ago about this hour, I was praying in my house at about the ninth hour.

And behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing and said, Cornelius, your prayers have been heard and your arms have been received and have been remembered before God.

Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon, who is called Peter.

He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner by the sea.

So I send for you at once and you have been kind enough to come.

Now, therefore, all are here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.

So now we get this repetition again, again.

Right.

This is now the second time we've heard this story.

And he's like, I want to hear what you have to say, what the Lord has commanded you to do.

OK.

Verse 34.

So Peter opened his mouth and said, truly, I understand that God shows no partiality.

But in every nation, anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.

OK, so this is kind of a big deal.

This is the first time Peter is presenting the gospel to a Gentile.

But these people are also sympathetic to the Jewish faith.

So he starts his address with saying how God shows no partiality.

But in every nation, anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.

Right.

Cornelius had this reputation of being in God fear.

And Peter is making that known.

Hey, good on you.

Good on you.

And now Peter continues with the statement about God as well as Jesus.

As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ.

He is Lord of all.

The first thing that he emphasizes that God has fulfilled his promise of salvation to the people of Israel through Jesus.

The word that he sent to Israel.

Right.

This is from of old.

Good news of peace through Jesus Christ.

He is Lord of all.

The second point that Peter emphasizes is that God's salvation through Jesus is offered to not just the Jew, but to the Gentile because he is Lord of all.

And Peter assumes somewhat that they were familiar with Jesus' work and ministry as he continues on in verse 37.

You yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed.

How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit with power.

And he went about doing good and healing.

Okay, so Peter makes these claims about Jesus.

That he is God's anointed.

He is set apart by God.

He also says that Jesus was with the Holy Spirit, meaning the presence of the Holy Spirit was in Jesus and has made the saving and transforming power of God a reality through the work of Jesus.

He also says that Jesus is the power of God.

And Jesus revealed the power of God, the power and spirit of God through his works and his healings.

Now, Peter is going to turn this.

He made some claims about God, made some claims about Jesus, and now he's going to make it personal.

Verse 39.

And we both, and we are witnesses of all that he did, both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem.

They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear.

Not to all people, but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.

And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be the judge of the living and the dead.

So Peter says, hey, I'm a witness of Jesus' ministry, his life, his death, his resurrection.

Peter also mentions how Jesus commanded them to preach and to testify that Jesus was appointed by God.

And then Peter gives one last sentence in verse 43.

So everyone who believes in Jesus receives the forgiveness of sins through his name.

Verse 44.

While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.

And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on Gentiles.

For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God.

So as Peter is giving his sermon, the spirit falls on all who heard the word.

And Luke's concern here is not the sequence of repentance, faith, and reception of the Holy Spirit, but the falling of the Spirit and the dramatic nature of what happened, which is why in verse 45, right, it emphasizes the believers who came with Peter from Joppa were amazed because the Holy Spirit fell on the Gentiles.

Then Peter declared, can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?

And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

Then they asked him to remain for some days.

I can almost imagine Peter kind of like, like, can anyone of these, like, can anyone dispute of these people being baptized?

Does anyone want to go against God?

I can't, like, he's just kind of amazed.

He's flabbergasted.

These Gentiles are part of the covenant family.

The vision is starting to make sense now.

God has purified these Gentiles and he is including them into his holy temple.

And, of course, the Old Testament speaks of this happening.

Isaiah 60, verse 1.

Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.

For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples.

But the Lord will rise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.

And nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.

The emphasis there on verse 3 in Isaiah 60.

And nations, not just the nation of Israel, but plural, nations shall come to your light.

Then, of course, we can look at the covenant that God makes with Abraham in Genesis 12.

God promised Abraham and his descendants that there would be a blessing that would come to all the people.

And, of course, that is fulfilled in Jesus.

The greatest blessing from Abraham extends to all the nations and all the people.

Jesus speaks of this.

John 10, verse 16.

And I have other sheep that are not of this fold.

I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice.

So there will be one flock, one shepherd.

John 12, verse 32.

And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.

Will draw all people to myself.

Peter, the leader of the Jerusalem church, is not only baptizing these people, but he's also staying in their house.

He is with the unclean people, doing the things that God has commanded him to do.

We could point to a lot of different important things of this passage, but what the author Luke makes a point to is the repetition of the Gentiles, and the repetition of the vision of things being clean.

We can also look back with the Samaritans, of course.

Peter, they call for Peter back in the Jerusalem church.

When Peter, when the Spirit falls on the Samaritans, Peter goes and almost like blesses them, if you will.

It's like, oh wow, it's gone to the Samaritans.

And now here we see it with the Gentiles.

And it's really easy for us to look at this story and go like, yeah, that's awesome, super cool, yay God, way to go.

But the last time I checked, none of us in here are Jewish.

Now I didn't like 23andMe to see if that's in your ethnicity.

But again, I think this has to do more with ethnicity.

It has to do with your religion, your faith.

And none of us are Jewish.

We're all Gentiles.

We were outside of the fold.

We were outside of God's people, His chosen people, until He sent His Son Jesus to restore and create this new covenant people.

God in all of His love and His grace and mercy came towards us and saved us.

And now anyone can be saved by faith in Jesus Christ.

As we start to wrap up this morning, and as I was thinking about some sort of application, some sort of question, take away for us this morning, other than to marvel and wonder and just worship God because of this plan to save not just the Jew but the Gentile and to be filled with worship at what God has done for us, how He has saved us.

I also want to ask, where are you like Peter?

Do you have a mixed worldview?

See, Peter was living his Christian faith with Jewish rituals.

And of course, he didn't know better.

I mean, he was born a Jew, raised a Jew.

Jesus was a Jew.

They're kind of in this, a whole new world.

That's what he was kind of doing, filling it out.

Of course, he didn't know any better.

That's all he knew.

And God had to show him differently.

And may I submit to you that you have the same problem.

Whether you've grown up in church or not, or if you grew up in different denominations or multiple denominations, what happens is, as we go on in life, we take a little bit of this experience, a little bit of that experience, and a little bit of this church, a little bit of that church.

And then we have our own preferences.

Well, I really just like this.

And that's how we build our Christian worldview.

And I don't want to have a Christian worldview.

I want to have a biblical worldview.

I want my whole life to be submitted to the Scripture.

Why?

Because my preferences, my experiences, and my feelings, they all change all the time.

And I want my worldview and aim to be steady, to be never changing.

And the word, it never changes.

It's been given to us by God.

It is the Word of God.

And so practically, how does that shape out?

How can I make sure I'm living a biblical worldview and not a Christian worldview?

First, read the Scriptures.

And not just a verse of the day, which is fine.

Rather, a verse of the day than nothing.

But we should be trying our best to be reading big chunks of Scripture out of time.

Why?

Because that helps us see a bigger perspective in the Scriptures.

Or if we cherry-pick a verse, it can be easy to build your own worldview.

And so we want to read big chunks of Scripture at a time.

Next, we also have, like, creeds.

Right?

Like the Apostles' Creed, what we declared this morning, what we said and recited this morning.

The creeds are ancient ways to declare what you believe.

It also helps us see where there might be heresy.

So, like, the Apostles' Creed, I believe in God the Father Almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth, or Maker of heaven and earth.

What does that tell us about God?

That He is Almighty.

That He is the Maker, Creator of heaven and earth.

And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, our Lord, He saved all, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, He was crucified and was buried.

He descended into hell.

The third day He rose again from the dead.

He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.

From there He will come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church.

Of course, when we say Catholic, we're meaning universal, the all-encompassing, the church, not the Roman Catholic Church.

The communion of the saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting.

Just declaring those things, that helps us kind of have a have a clearer picture of what we believe, about who God is, about what Jesus, His Son, has done, about what the Spirit does.

Then, of course, we have the confessions.

And as a church, we hold to the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689.

And this helps us see the bigger picture in Scripture.

It helps us see where in Scripture we actually get our beliefs and our doctrine.

It helps us see things in a more clearer sense to have a greater understanding of, well, where do we get this law and gospel distinction?

What about the covenant of grace?

What about where in the Scriptures can I get a better understanding of who God is, of who Christ is, of who the Spirit is, of how the church?

What about the sacraments or the ordinances?

What about baptism and the Lord's Supper?

All these things.

That's why we have these confessions and, again, even our catechism.

That's why we go over it weekly is to build a biblical worldview for our family and our children.

The other day we were in family worship at our home and we were going over the Trinity we're looking in creation how God, we can see the Trinity already in the first pages of the Scriptures.

And I was like, yeah, I was talking to my kids and going, yeah, you know, like God is, He's a triune God and my girls go, yeah, God the Father, Christ the Son and the Holy Spirit.

There was no doubt.

There was no question.

There was no hesitation.

They just knew it because we've been teaching it, because we've been going over it in our catechism, because we've been talking about it as a family.

There's no doubt, no hesitation.

And so read the Scriptures.

Crack open the Confession.

Go over the Catechism, not just on Sunday, but go over it, whether you have kids or not.

What is your worldview built on?

Are you living a Christian worldview or a biblical worldview?

Where are you letting your emotions, past experiences and assumptions rule your life?

And how can those things be submitted to the Word of God?

Let's pray together.

Jesus, we thank you for your sovereignty.

How from the beginning of time you promised to send one who would be a blessing to all people. we know and we have found that in your Son, Jesus.

And we thank you for salvation being in his name and through his work.

Would you lead us and guide us in the way of righteousness?

May we build our lives not on thought, opinion, feeling, or experience, but may we build our lives on the truth of your Scriptures.

You tell us that your Word is truth and we believe that.

So Spirit, help us learn it, keep it, and do what you say.

In Jesus' name, everyone said, Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

I want to remind us that this Wednesday we have our prayer gathering right here, 7 p.m. in this place, as well as if you don't have a copy of the Second London Baptist Confession and you would like one of those, we have some of those available if you need it or like it or you lost it.

So just come find me and I can grab you one of those.

Awesome.

Have a good week.

Have a good week.
