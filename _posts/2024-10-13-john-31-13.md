## Transcription

This morning we will open up to chapter 3 of the book of John and one of my favorite passages actually like one of my favorite just kind of like little stories and sections here at the first part.

I really liked it and then started to dig in to study and to preach this passage and there was a lot that I learned about this passage and about this story here at the beginning of chapter 3.

And so if somebody wants to read, we're just going to read chapter 3 verses 1 through 21.

If somebody wants to read that and then we'll jump into the rest of...

Yeah, we'll jump into this.

Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old?

Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?

Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.

That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

Do not marvel that I said to you, you must be born again.

The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.

So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.

Nicodemus said to him, How can these things be?

Jesus answered him, Are you the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?

Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony.

If I have told you earthly things, and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.

And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.

For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.

For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.

Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.

And this is the judgment.

The light has come into the world, and the people love darkness rather than light, because their works were evil.

For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.

But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may clearly seem that his works have been carried out in God.

Awesome.

Thank you.

I want to shout out Josh for bringing the word last week.

It was a great message.

And we're actually going to start in our study of, we're just going to finish at verse 13 this morning.

So we won't hit the big one, the 316.

We'll save that for next week.

But, because we gain context here, because it jumps in right away like 3-1, right?

Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus.

But if we look at the last section of verses in chapter 2, verse 23, we'll sort of see how the gospel writer John here is setting up what's next in this letter or this book.

Because it says in chapter 2, verse 23, Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing.

But Jesus, on his part, did not entrust himself to them because he knew all people, and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.

Now, there was a man of the Pharisees.

So already we get this sort of picture of what this story is going to be.

Because Jesus already knows what's in man.

And so he's going to, he's not, he's already, John the writer is pulling at this idea of, Okay, so he just told us that Jesus knows what's in man.

So there's going to be some confusion.

There's going to be some tension within these next couple stories.

And we see that here with Nicodemus.

Then chapter 4, once we get to the woman at the well, we'll see Jesus interacting with these people, and already knowing what's in them, and sort of leading and guiding these conversations to, to either believe in him, or to struggle with the tension of what we don't know.

And so there was a man named Nicodemus.

And so let's just quickly uncover who Nicodemus is.

It says that he was a man of the Pharisees and ruler of the Jews.

And so Nicodemus was a man of high authority in the religious leadership of Israel.

He was also a member of the Sanhedrin, which was the ruling body of the Jewish people.

And not all Pharisees were in the Sanhedrin.

If you were in this council, you would have been a chosen official among this religious governing body.

So almost like a senator, but not voted on by the people.

It would have just been like, you know, one of the Sanhedrin in their council says, Brother Jeffrey just died.

Now we need to replace him, you know, whatever their process was.

And so that kind of ruler, that sort of status.

So, but we also see that Nicodemus was not just this sort of ruler, sort of pseudo political figure for the people of Israel, but he was also a teacher of Israel.

And we see that in verse 10, when Jesus rebukes him, are you not, or are you the teacher of Israel?

And yet you do not understand these things that Jesus questions him.

And so we see that Nicodemus is also this teacher.

So he should have had some, he would have had a very robust Old Testament understanding and knowledge of the scriptures.

And so, but then on the flip side of that, we see that Nicodemus also recognized that Jesus was some sort of prophet, or some sort of person from God, when he addressed him in verse two.

He says, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher, that you are a teacher who's come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with them.

So Nicodemus had this, he personally was a man of stature, right?

He was a man of some authority within the Israelites and the Jewish people at the time.

But also, he had some sort of understanding of what Jesus was doing.

And he had heard the signs, maybe seen them, we don't know, we don't see that.

But also, this shows us that Jesus was doing more signs than what we've just seen in the text, right?

Because we get the wedding and then he turns the temple tables.

And so of what we see in the text, we just have that one miracle.

But Nicodemus says that there were signs, multiple.

There was a lot more signs than what we have in the context and story that John is unfolding for us.

And here at our current stop in John chapter three.

So Jesus had done more signs that were not written or yeah.

And so Jesus has this conversation with Nicodemus.

And as we've seen over the last couple of weeks, right?

We started off with the new wine at the wedding in Cana.

And then Jesus, he says he's going to rebuild a new temple, which is his body, which we talked about last week.

And now there is this new birth, right?

In John three, three, Jesus answered him, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

So when Jesus addresses Nicodemus, he does it twice.

He says truly, truly twice.

And he is speaking from like a complete place of authority.

When he says truly, truly, he is like, mark my words, like, like, like write this down.

Like, this is the big picture.

And in the commentaries that I was studying through, it talked about how like in the translation from the Greek to English, we don't really have the sort of like almost seal stamp that that signifies like sign seal delivered.

I'm yours kind of thing.

Um, thanks to even wonder.

Uh, but it's trying to encapsulate like this is, I am speaking from like all absolute truth.

This is, I am, Jesus is speaking with true authority, with, uh, true assuredness, true certainty.

And, uh, he is saying, don't miss this absolute truth.

Um, so what is the absolute truth?

Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

That is the truth.

Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

Unless one is born again, you cannot enter into the place where the reign of God is manifest, uh, which we often just call heaven.

Um, and we have to notice the, the very first word there in that truth claim is unless this is something that has to happen.

There is no, uh, sliding past the rebirth.

It is a necessary fact that has to happen.

Um, yes, we all have a physical birth in the natural.

Um, if you, if you didn't, you wouldn't be here, right?

We all have to have had been born, but if you want to enter into the kingdom of God, there must be a supernatural birth.

Uh, you've probably heard the phrase born again, Christian, right?

Um, which, uh, I've come to learn that the phrase born again, Christian was popularized by an advisor on, uh, president Nixon, uh, to, was an advisor to president Nixon in the 1970s.

And then, uh, this advisor wrote a book, which was titled born again.

And then president Carter, uh, made it famous later on when he said he was a born again, Christian.

And that's where the saying really got its legs and come came to its popularity.

Um, but when you say you are a born again, Christian, you're just, you're just repeating yourself because there is no such thing as a Christian who's not born again.

Uh, a person cannot be in Christ unless he or she is regenerate, unless he or she is, is made new.

You cannot be in Christ if you are not made new by him and through him.

That's just a little fun factor for you.

Uh, so after Jesus' truth claim in verse three, then, uh, Nicodemus said to him in verse four, how can a man be born when he is old?

Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born again?

Now, again, we somewhat have uncovered the, uh, the knowledge of Nicodemus.

So he was not a, a, a dumb person.

He, I think he was asking like a, almost like a clarifying question.

Like, is this what you're, this is what you're getting at.

He, he needs some clarification.

So then Jesus answers him in, in verse five.

Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.

That which is born of flesh is flesh.

And that which is born of spirit is spirit.

Do not marvel that I said to you, you must be born again.

The wind blows where it wishes and you hear it sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.

So it is with everyone who is born of the spirit.

So Jesus, uh, in response to Nicodemus's question, he expands on his, uh, what would seem to be a very concise answer and gives a little bit more explanation to it.

And, uh, from our perspective could be, uh, sort of muddying the waters a little bit.

So a person must be born of water and the spirit, which that phrase right there, born of water and of spirit has brought many different explanations among biblical scholars.

And there's, uh, some debate and some confusion and there's like five or six different arguments that, uh, one of the commentaries that I was reading, uh, through and reference, um, a lot here, um, is by this, uh, guy named D.

A.

Carson.

And, uh, he brought up maybe six or seven different arguments of how this passage can be taken when we think of born of water and born of spirit.

And I'm not going to, uh, go through all of them, but I will highlight two of them and probably ones that we might have initially thought of from our 21st century Christian worldview.

And when he thinks of, when he says, when, uh, Jesus says born of water and born of spirit, uh, if you're like me, you probably think of baptism, right?

Like born of water, water, we don't, that's the thing that we do and born of spirit.

Um, and, but so let's, let's think of the two different kinds of baptism, which is two different arguments that, uh, people will bring to the text.

Um, born of water, let's go, let's start with John's baptism, since that would have been the baptism of the time.

Um, and so if we were to assume that Jesus is talking about John's baptism, the proper logic to that would be that just merely mentioning water would mean that Jesus is referring, to John's baptism because he does not specifically say born of water through John's baptism or water through a baptism of repentance.

There's none of that.

It's just water.

That's the only word we get in the text.

And so clearly it's not just John's baptism of repentance, John the Baptist, of course.

Uh, so we, we can kind of go like, all right, that doesn't seem too legit because it, it, Jesus merely just says the word water.

And so to equate water and John's baptism is a little silly.

And then we can take that even a step further and think of our Christian baptism.

And then we would have to jump over the fact if we assume that Christian baptism was Jesus's meaning in saying born of water and born of spirit, we would have to jump over the fact that Jesus is not having a conversation with us.

He's having a conversation with Nicodemus.

So if Jesus and John writing this down and, and saying that Jesus's words are born of water in reference to Christian baptism, then we would be completely disregarding the fact that Jesus was having a conversation with a teacher of the Jews, a teacher of the Israelites.

And so that too is us reading our own context, which I have done with this passage before of thinking it's baptism into the text.

And so then what do we do about it?

And, uh, thankfully there are much who are smarter than me and to, uh, whose knowledge I'm, I'm leaning on here.

And in the study of these different commentaries and things of that nature, which, uh, sort of lead to the, uh, explanation of let's read the full argument and the full conversation.

And then we might gather some more information to understand more of the context of maybe what Jesus was getting at.

Um, so, uh, truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.

That which is born of flesh is flesh.

And that which is born of spirit is spirit.

Do not marvel that I said to you, you must be born again.

The wind blows where it wishes and hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.

So it is with everyone who is born of the spirit.

Right there in that last, in Jesus's question to Nicodemus's question, that gives us a little bit of more understanding that Jesus is trying to get to.

He's saying, are you not a teacher of Israel?

Do you not understand the Torah or did, did you misinterpret something in the text?

You are a teacher of Israel, right?

So he's bringing up this, uh, he's bringing up the old Testament and, and saying, Hey, you should have somewhat of an understanding of what I'm getting at.

And so for us, if that's Jesus's response to Nicodemus, after he questions, what are you speaking of?

Then we should probably look at the old Testament and see where spirit and water sort of come together or, or where are they both mentioned?

Where are both spirit and water mentioned?

And, uh, which if we do, we can look at the old Testament prophets, particularly Ezekiel, which has multiple references to pull from, but, uh, I'm just going to highlight one for time as well as it hits, it hits both.

So there's multiple Ezekiel references of, of spirit, and then there's multiple Ezekiel references of water.

But right here in Ezekiel chapter 36 verses 25 and 27, the, uh, the prophet writes again, these, these are the words of, of, of God through the prophet Ezekiel says, Again, We're looking for water and spirit.

We're, we're looking for references to water and spirit.

I'll read the Ezekiel passage one more time.

Again, this is Ezekiel 36, 25 through 27.

So we see here in this Ezekiel passage, and again, it's all, it's sprinkled all throughout Ezekiel.

But, uh, for time, this one, I think does, it does its job.

Uh, water and spirit come together.

The first to signify a cleansing from impurity.

And the second to, uh, show the transformation of heart that will enable people to fully follow God.

And so to me, from my study, this is, I think what Jesus was getting at.

Could there be another interpretation?

I'm sure of it.

Uh, in fact, I know there's about six or seven other popular ones.

Um, but this one to me takes the context of a, of a teacher of Israel and Jesus is, is speaking to this teacher of Israel and uses his own language.

It's uses his own, uh, his own book to really bring understanding to what Jesus is doing.

And it's, it's right there.

The water is a cleansing.

And, and from that cleansing, there is no, there is no rebirth.

There is no renewal of the spirit.

If, if, if you are not clean and all that happens through God.

And if we were to turn the page to chapter 37 in Ezekiel, we would see it's the story where, uh, Ezekiel through the, through the power and the spirit of God, uh, these dry bones turn into a new life.

It's, it's, it's crazy.

So there's this cleansing and transformation that takes place when we come to life in Jesus Christ.

And of course, this is all done through God, through the power of the spirit.

And as Jesus was talking to this teacher of the law, he, he, of course, he's, he knows what's in him.

And so he's going to speak what he knows and Nicodemus misses it.

But then Jesus says in verse six, so that's the water spirit.

Let's continue on break this down a little further and then we'll carry on.

Uh, verse six.

That which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit.

So no one is born a Jesus follower, right?

Uh, the flesh does not produce redemption.

The flesh produces condemnation.

Uh, but this was a common belief amongst Jews because I am part of the Royal ancestry.

Because I am part of, uh, of the family of Abraham who had many sons and many sons had father Abraham.

I am one of them and so are you.

So let's just praise the Lord because of that.

I'm in cool.

We're good.

My family, my bloodline is right.

I'm a pure blood.

I am not a mud blood.

I'm a pure blood.

Uh, because of that, I'm in.

And today, right for us, it's, I was raised in a Christian family.

I went to a Christian school growing up.

We prayed around meals.

I, I, we did everything right.

Like, blessed and highly favored.

Uh, but none of those things make you a Christian.

Um, all that your natural birth gives you is flesh and all our flesh gives us is absolute, uh, rebellion and rejection of anything of God.

Our flesh condemns you and it is not a ticket to the pearly gates.

Our flesh is not that.

And Jesus says that which is born of flesh is flesh, but that which is born of spirit is spirit.

So unless you are born of the spirit of the living God, whatever you do in your flesh will do nothing towards entering the kingdom of God.

Our flesh produces death.

But the spirit brings life.

Jesus continues in verse seven.

Do not marvel that I said to you, you must be born again.

The wind blows where it wishes and you hear it sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.

So it is with everyone who is born of the spirit.

The wind blows wherever it wants to.

Sometimes, uh, as we've seen here in the last couple of weeks, very powerfully, but we cannot see it.

We can see only the consequences of it, the manifestation of its power, but we do not fully know where it comes from or where it's going.

Just as everyone who is born of the spirit is someone like that because spiritual rebirth is the work of God.

We cannot predict it.

We cannot make it happen on our own.

It is the spirit at work within us and through us that allows us to be reborn.

Ephesians two, four through five, but God being rich in mercy because of great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.

Paul here is speaking about that, this regeneration, the act of giving or receiving new life.

This is the, a supernatural work and it is done completely by the power of God.

And it is something that only God can do.

We cannot cause or will ourselves to be reborn.

And it's funny because that's what Nicodemus said.

So am I supposed to enter my mother's womb yet again?

He, he's trying to do it on his own.

And what is Jesus saying?

No, you cannot do this.

It's just like the wind.

You, you don't know where it's coming from.

You don't know where it's going, but you, you feel it.

You see it and you don't see it.

Uh, verse nine, Nicodemus said to him, how can these things be?

Jesus answered him.

Are you not the teacher of Israel?

And yet you do not understand these things.

Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony.

If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the son of man.

The main point that Jesus was communicating with these words was that he had the authority to speak about eternal truths.

For he knew them and he had seen them having come from the presence of God and having descended down to earth.

He is revealing these things about the kingdom of God and he's trying to do so and communicate in an earthly manner.

But if Nicodemus himself does not understand it, then how could he explain to him the things from above?

How could he explain to him heavenly things if he's not believing what he's saying about earthly things?

We will spend some more time looking at this answer and this conversation next week when we continue on.

And we'll answer that.

How can this be that Nicodemus final question?

But it is, I think, very important that we spend some time and understand and remind ourselves that not everyone who cries, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven.

We'll enter into the presence of God unless one is born of water and the spirit, he or she cannot enter the kingdom of God.

There is an absolute requirement to enter the kingdom.

And we might sometimes struggle with this.

Our culture, our world struggles with there being any sort of absolute truth.

But Jesus here speaks with absolute truth and absolute certainty that unless one is born again, they cannot enter the kingdom of God.

They cannot see the kingdom of God.

A person must be changed by God.

The disposition of our hearts, which by nature does not want to be controlled or be submitted to God.

Must be altered, not by us, but must be altered by God and his spirit.

And that happens when we come to faith in him.

And how beautiful of a reminder that that prophecy that we read in Ezekiel has come to pass.

That Jesus did cleanse us, that Jesus did purify us, that through belief in Jesus, through accepting the gift of salvation, we receive that cleansing.

We also receive that new heart, our heart of stone is replaced with the heart of flesh.

And all of that happened through Jesus.

And Jesus is simply going, hey, Nicodemus, that's here and now.

I'm standing in front of you.

That which was with God, seated with God, has descended into heaven and is with you now.

Now, this story I've always loved, for what reason, I don't know.

I just, I think this whole idea of being reborn is really cool and interesting and I've come to love this passage more because I think I've started to see the Nicodemus in me.

I've started to see how I've wondered and questioned, how can I make this happen?

How can I do this?

How can I?

And how can I, how can I force this upon myself?

How can this be?

And I have lovingly taken the rebuke of Jesus.

Who simply goes, truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

And so I have to sit and remember that because of salvation in Jesus, I am born again.

And we have this amazing, loving father who has given us new life, who has turned us into born again Christians.

That's all I got.
