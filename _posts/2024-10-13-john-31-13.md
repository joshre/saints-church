## Transcription

This morning we will open up to chapter 3 of the book of John and one of my favorite passages actually like one of my favorite just kind of like little stories and sections here at the first part I really liked it and then started to dig in to study and to preach this passage and there was a lot that I learned about this passage and about this story here at the beginning of chapter 3 and so if somebody wants to read we're just gonna read chapter 3 verses 1 through 21 if somebody wants to read that and then we'll jump into the rest of yeah we'll jump into this said to him rabbi we know that you are a teacher come from God for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him Jesus answered him truly truly I say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said to him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered truly truly I say to you unless one is born of water and spirit he cannot enter the that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit do not marvel that I said to you you must be born again the wind blows where it wishes and you hear it sound but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit Nicodemus said to him how can these things be he's answered him are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things truly truly I say to you we speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen you do not receive our testimony I have told you earthly things and you do not believe how can you believe if I tell you heaven things no one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven the son of man and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life for God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the only son of God and this is the judgment the light has come into the world and the people love darkness rather than light because their works were evil for everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light lest his work should be exposed but whoever does what is true comes to the light so that it may clearly seem that his work have been carried out awesome thank you I want to shout out Josh for bringing the word last week it was a great message and we're actually gonna start in our study of we're just going to finish at verse 13 this this morning so we won't hit the the big one the 316 we'll save that for next week but because we gained context here because it jumps in right away like 3-1 right now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus but if we look at the last section of verses in chapter 2 verse 23 we'll sort of see how the gospel writer John here is setting up what's next in this letter or this book because it says in chapter 2 verse 23 now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing but Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them because he knew all people and needed no one to bear witness about man for he himself knew what was in man now there was a man of the Pharisees so already we get this already we get this sort of picture of what this story is going to be because Jesus already knows what's in man and so he's going to he's not he's already John the writer is pulling at this idea of okay so he just told us that Jesus knows what's in man so there's going to be some confusion there's going to be some tension within these next couple stories and we see that here with Nicodemus then chapter 4 once we get to the woman at the well we'll see Jesus interacting with these people and already knowing what's in them and sort of leading and guiding these conversations to to either believe in him or to struggle with the tension of what we don't know and so there was a man named Nicodemus and so let's just quickly uncover who Nicodemus is it says that he was a man of the Pharisees and ruler of the Jews and so Nicodemus was a man of high authority in the religious leadership of Israel he was also a member of the Sanhedrin which was the ruling body of the Jewish people and not all Pharisees were in the Sanhedrin if you were in this council you would have been a chosen official among this religious governing body so almost like a senator but not voted on by the people it would have just been like you know one of the Sanhedrin in their council says brother Jeffrey just died and now we need to replace him you know whatever their process was and so that kind of ruler that sort of status so but we also see that Nicodemus was not just this sort of ruler sort of pseudo political figure for the people of Israel but he was also a teacher of Israel and we see that in verse 10 when Jesus rebukes him are you not or are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things that's what Jesus questions him and so we see that Nicodemus is also this teacher so he should have had some he would have had a very robust Old Testament understanding and knowledge of the scriptures and so but then on the flip side of that we see that Nicodemus also recognized that Jesus was some sort of prophet or some sort of person from God when he addressed him in verse 2 he says rabbi we know that you are a teacher that you are a teacher who's come from God for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with them so Nicodemus had this he personally was a man of stature right he was a man of some authority within the Israelites and the Jewish people at the time but also he had some sort of understanding of what Jesus was doing and he had heard the signs maybe seen them we don't we don't know we don't see that but also this shows us that Jesus was doing more signs than what we've just seen in the text right because we get the the wedding and then he turns the temple tables and so of what we see in the text we just have that one miracle but Nicodemus says that there were signs multiple there was a lot more signs than what we have in the context and story that John is unfolding for us and here at our current stop in John chapter 3 so Jesus had done more signs that were not written or yeah and so Jesus has this conversation with Nicodemus and as we've seen over the last couple weeks right we started off with the new wine at the wedding in Cana and then Jesus he's he says he's going to rebuild a new temple which is his body which we talked about last week and now there is this new birth right in John 3 3 Jesus answered him truly truly I say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so when Jesus addresses Nicodemus he does it twice he says truly truly twice and he is speaking from like a complete place of authority when he says truly truly he is like mark my words like like like write this down like this is the big picture and in the commentaries that I was studying through it talked about how like in the translation from the Greek to English we don't really have the sort of like almost seal stamp that sit that signifies like sign seal delivered I'm yours kind of thing thanks even wonder but it's trying to encapsulate like this is I am speaking from like all absolute truth this is I am Jesus is speaking with true authority with true assuredness true certainty and he is saying don't miss this absolute truth so what is the absolute truth unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God that is the truth unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God unless one is born again you cannot enter into the place where the reign of God is manifest which we often just call heaven and we have to notice the the very first word there in that truth claim is unless this is something that has to happen there is no sliding past the rebirth it is a necessary fact that has to happen yes we all have a physical birth in the natural if you if you didn't you wouldn't be here right we all have to have had been born but if you want to enter into the kingdom of God there must be a supernatural birth you've probably heard the phrase born again Christian right which I've come to learn that the phrase born again Christian was popularized by an advisor on President Nixon was an advisor to President Nixon in the 1970s and then this advisor wrote a book which was titled born again and then President Carter made it famous later on when he said he was a born-again Christian and that's where the saying really got its legs and come came to its popularity but when you say you are a born-again Christian you're just you're just repeating yourself because there is no such thing as a Christian who's not born again a person cannot be in Christ unless he or she is regenerate unless he or she is is made new you cannot be in Christ if you are not made new by him and through him that's just a little fun fact there for you so after Jesus' truth claim in verse 3 then Nicodemus said to him in verse 4 how can a man be born when he is old can you enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born again now again we somewhat have uncovered the the knowledge of Nicodemus so he was not a dumb person he I think he was asking like a almost like a clarifying question like is this what you're this is what you're getting at he needs some clarification so then Jesus answers him in in verse 5 truly truly I say to you unless one is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit do not marvel that I said to you you must be born again the wind blows where it wishes and you hear it sound but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit so Jesus in response to Nicodemus's question he expands on his what would seem to be a very concise answer and gives a little more explanation to it and from our perspective could be sort of muddying the waters a little bit so a person must be born of water and the spirit which that phrase right there born of water and of spirit has brought many different among biblical scholars and there's a some debate and some confusion and there's like five or six different arguments that one of the commentaries that I was reading through and reference a lot here is by this guy named da Carson and he brought up maybe six or seven different arguments of how this passage can be taken when we think of born of water and born of spirit and I'm not going to go through all of them but I will highlight two of them and probably ones that we might have initially thought of from our 21st century Christian worldview and when he thinks of when he says when Jesus says born of water and born of spirit if you're like me you probably think of baptism right like born of water water we don't that's the thing that we do and born of spirit and but so let's let's think of the two different kinds of baptism which is two different arguments that people will bring to the text born of water let's go let's start with John's baptism since that would have been the baptism of the time and so if we were to assume that Jesus is talking about John's baptism the proper logic to that would be that just merely mentioning water would mean that Jesus is referring to John's baptism because he does not specifically say born of water through John's baptism or water through a baptism of repentance there's none of that it's just water that's the only word we get in the text and so clearly it's not just John's baptism of repentance John the Baptist of course so we we can kind of go like all right that doesn't seem too legit because it Jesus merely just says the word water and so to equate water and John's baptism is a little silly and then we can take that even a step further and think of our Christian baptism and then we would have to jump over the fact if we assume that Christian baptism was Jesus's meaning in saying born of water and born of spirit we would have to jump over the fact that Jesus is not having a conversation with us he's having a conversation with Nicodemus so if Jesus and John writing this down and saying that Jesus's words are born of water in reference to Christian baptism then we would be completely disregarding the fact that Jesus was having a conversation with a teacher of the Jews a teacher of the Israelites and so that too is us reading our own context which I have done with this passage before of thinking it's baptism into the text and so then what do we do about it and thankfully there are much who are smarter than me and to whose knowledge I'm I'm leaning on here and in the study of these different commentaries and things of that nature which sort of lead to the explanation of let's read the full argument and the full conversation and then we might gather some more information to understand more of the context of maybe what Jesus was getting at so truly truly I say to you unless one is born of water in the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit do not marvel that I said to you you must be born again the wind blows where it wishes and hear it sound but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit Nicodemus said to him how can these things be Jesus answered him are you not a teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things right there in that last in Jesus's question to Nicodemus's question that gives us a little bit of more understanding that Jesus is trying to get to he's saying are you not a teacher of Israel do you not understand the Torah or did you misinterpret something in the text you are a teacher of Israel right so he's bringing up this he's bringing up the Old Testament and and saying hey you should have somewhat of an understanding of what I'm getting at and so for us if that's Jesus's response to Nicodemus after he questions what are you speaking of then we should probably look at the Old Testament and see where spirit and water sort of come together or where are they both mentioned where both spirit and water mentioned and which if we do we can look at the Old Testament prophets particularly Ezekiel which has multiple references to pull from but I'm just gonna highlight one for time as well as it hits it hits both so there's multiple Ezekiel references of spirit and then there's multiple Ezekiel references of water but right here in Ezekiel chapter 36 verses 25 and 27 the the prophet writes again these are the words of of of God through the prophet Ezekiel says I will sprinkle clean water on you and you shall be clean from all your uncleanness and from all your idols I will cleanse you and I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will put within you and I will remove your heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules again we're looking for water and spirit we're looking for references to water and spirit I'll read the Ezekiel passage one more time again this is Ezekiel 36 25 through 27 I will sprinkle clean water on you and you shall be cleaned from all your uncleanness and from all your idols I will cleanse you and I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will put within you and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules so we see here in this Ezekiel passage and again it's all it's sprinkled all throughout Ezekiel but for time this one I think it does its job water and spirit come together the first to signify a cleansing from impurity and the second to show the transformation of heart that will enable people to fully follow God and so to me from my study this is I think what Jesus was getting at could there be another interpretation I'm sure of it in fact I know there's about six or seven other popular ones but this one to me takes the context of a teacher of Israel and Jesus is speaking to this teacher of Israel and uses his own language uses his own his own book to really bring understanding to what Jesus is doing and it's it's right there the water is a cleansing and and from that cleansing there is no there is no rebirth there is no renewal of the spirit if you are not clean and all that happens through God and if we were to turn the page to chapter 37 in Ezekiel we would see it's the story where Ezekiel through the through the power and the Spirit of God these dry bones turn into a new life it's it's it's crazy so there's this cleansing and transformation that takes place when we come to life in Jesus Christ and of course this is all done through God through the power of the and as Jesus was talking to this teacher of the law he he of course he's he knows what's in him and so he's going to speak what he knows and Nicodemus misses it but then Jesus says in verse 6 so that's the water spirit let's continue on and break this down a little further and then we'll carry on verse 6 that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit so no one is born a Jesus follower right the flesh does not produce redemption the flesh produces condemnation but this was a common belief amongst Jews because I am part of the royal ancestry because I am part of of the family of Abraham who had many sons and many sons had father Abraham I am one of them and so are you so let's just praise the Lord because of that I'm in cool we're good my bloodline is right I'm a pure blood I am NOT a mudblood I am a pure blood because of that I'm in and today right for us it's I was raised in a Christian family I went to a Christian school growing up we prayed around meals I I we did everything right like blessed and highly favored but none of those things make you a Christian all that your natural birth gives you is flesh and all our flesh gives us is absolute rebellion and rejection of anything of God our flesh condemns you and it is not a ticket to the pearly gates our flesh is not that and Jesus says that which is born of flesh is flesh but that which is born of spirit is spirit so unless you are born of the spirit of the living God whatever you do in your flesh will do nothing towards entering the kingdom of God our flesh produces death but the spirit brings life Jesus continues in verse 7 do not marvel that I said to you you must be born again the wind blows where it wishes and you hear it sound but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit the wind blows wherever it wants to sometimes as we've seen here in the last couple weeks very powerfully but we cannot see it we can see only the consequences of it the manifestation of its power but we do not fully know where it comes from or where it's going just as everyone who is born of the spirit is someone like that because spiritual rebirth is the work of God we cannot predict it we cannot make it happen on our own it is the spirit at work within us and through us that allows us to be reborn Ephesians 2 4 3 5 but God being rich in mercy because of great love with which he loved us even when we were dead in our trespasses made us alive together with Christ Paul here is speaking about that this regeneration the act of giving or receiving new life this is the a supernatural work and it is done completely by the power of God and it is something that only God can do we cannot cause or will ourselves to be reborn and it's funny because that's what Nicodemus said so am I supposed to enter my mother's womb yet again he's trying to do it on his own and what is Jesus saying no you cannot do this it's just like the wind you don't know where it's coming from you don't know where it's going but you you feel it you see it you don't see it verse 9 Nicodemus said to him how can these things be Jesus answered him are you not the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things truly truly I say to you we speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen but you do not receive our testimony if I have told you earthly things and you do not believe how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things no one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven the Son of Man the main point that Jesus was communicating with these words was that he had the authority to speak about eternal truths for he knew them and he had seen them having come from the presence of God and having descended down to earth he is revealing these eternal truths he is revealing these things about the kingdom of God and he's trying to do so and communicate in an earthly manner but if Nicodemus himself does not understand it then how could he explain to him the things from above how could he explain to him heavenly things if he's not believing what he's saying about earthly things we will spend some more time looking at this answer and this conversation next week when we continue on and we'll answer that how can this be that Nicodemus final question but it is I think very important that we spend some time and understand and remind ourselves that not everyone who cries Lord Lord will enter into the kingdom of heaven will enter into the presence of God unless one is born of water and the spirit he or she cannot enter the kingdom of God there is an absolute requirement to enter the kingdom and we might sometimes struggle with this our culture our world struggles with there being any sort of absolute truth but Jesus here speaks with absolute truth and absolute certainty that unless one is born again they cannot enter the kingdom of God they cannot see the kingdom of God a person must be changed by God the disposition of our hearts which by nature does not want to be controlled or be submitted to God must be altered not by us but must be altered by God and his spirit and that happens when we come to faith in him and how beautiful of a reminder that that prophecy that we read in Ezekiel has come to pass that Jesus did cleanse us that Jesus did purify us that through belief in Jesus through accepting the gift of salvation we receive that cleansing we also receive that new heart our heart of stone is replaced with a heart of flesh and all of that happened through Jesus and Jesus is simply going in Icademus that's here and now I'm standing in front of you that which was with God seeded with God has descended into heaven and is with you now this story I've always loved for what reason I don't know I just I think this whole idea of being reborn is really cool and interesting and I've come to love this passage more because I think I've I have started to see the Nicodemus in me I've started to see how I've wondered and questioned how can I make this happen how can I do this how can I and how can I how can I force this upon myself how can this be and I have lovingly taken the rebuke of Jesus who simply goes truly truly I say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and so I have to sit and remember that because of salvation in Jesus I am born again we have this amazing loving father who has given us new life who has turned us into born-again Christians that's all I got
