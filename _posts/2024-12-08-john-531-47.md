## Transcription

Jesus because he was doing these things on the Sabbath, but Jesus answered them.

My father is working until now and I'm working This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him because not only was he breaking the Sabbath But he was even calling his calling God his own father making himself equal with God So Jesus said to them truly truly I say to you the son can do nothing of his own accord But only what he sees the father doing for whatever the father does that the son does likewise For the father loves the son shows him all that he himself is doing and greater works than these will he show him For if the father raises the dead and gives them life so also the son gives life to The father judges no one but has given all judgment to the son that all may honor the son just as though Just as they honor the father whoever does not honor the son does not honor the father Truly truly I say to you whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me as eternal life He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life Truly truly I say to you and ours coming and is now here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God And those who hear will live for as the father has life in himself So he has granted the son also to have life in himself And he has given him authority to execute judgment because he is the son of man Do not marvel at this when our is coming when all who are in the tomb will hear his voice and come out Those who have done good to the resurrection of life and those who have done equal to the resurrection of judgment I Can do nothing on my own as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but The will of him who sent me if I alone bear witness about myself my testimony is not true There is another who bears witness about me and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true You sent to John and he has born witness to the truth Not that the testimony that I receive is for a man, but I say these things so that you may be saved He was burning and shot and shining lamp He was a burning and shining lamp and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his life But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John for the works that the father has given me to Accomplish the very works that I'm doing bear witness about me that the father has sent me and the father sent me has himself Born witness about me his voice you have never heard His for me have never seen and you do not have his word abiding in you for you do not believe The one whom he has sent you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and is And it is they that bear witness about me yet.

You refuse to come to me that you may have life I do not receive glory from people But I know that you do not have the love of God within you have come in my father's name And you do not receive me if another comes in his own name you will receive him How can you believe when you receive the glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?

Do not think that I will accuse you to the father There's one who accuses you of Moses on whom you have set your hope for if you believed Moses you would believe me He wrote but if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?

Thank you.

So Jesus is Here continue in the section that we're looking at today verses 31 through 47 Jesus continuing his defense again, he's he's talking to the religious Jews he's talking to the religious leaders and The first section that we looked at last week we sort of discovered and saw how it was more of a legal defense that he was putting and so We saw in Jesus claims that God and Jews are always working that Jesus is equal in works With the father that Jesus is equal in power with the father Jesus is the judge and Jesus is worthy of worship and now he is continuing on the stand if you will and At this time but this time he's bringing witnesses, right?

If you caught it there in that last part says witnesses multiple times and so his first witness that he brings up is John the Baptist and And Jesus says John Baptist's words are true And so then I the question is what has John the Baptist said about Jesus? in John 1 Sort of 26 through 34.

I'll read a couple of portions there.

It says John the Baptist says I baptized with water but among you stands one you do not know Even he who comes after me the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie So John the Baptist is saying You know as he was supposed to do he was declaring the way for Jesus preparing the way and it says There is one who's coming after me and I'm not worthy to untie his sandals Like there is one who is so much Like I am not even worthy to be a slave to him is essentially what John the Baptist is saying then later in Chapter 1 verse 29 says behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world This is he of whom I said after me comes a comes a man who ranks before me because he was before me So there is somebody who's coming after John the Baptist but he's Before John the Baptist of course not speaking in age but in speaking in I guess kind of speaking in age as well That Jesus is before John the Baptist he has come before John the Baptist although John the Baptist came before him We don't need to get twisted up in the semantics.

He calls him the Lamb of God, right and Verse 31 I myself did not know him but for this purpose I came baptizing with water that he might be revealed to Israel so There we see John is saying He was not just for this Group of people he was for all of Israel and of course Jesus came for more than Israel.

He came for the whole world Chapter 1 verse 32 and bore and John bore witness I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove and it remained on him I myself did not know him but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me he on whom you See the Spirit descend and remain This is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit and I have seen and I have borne witness that this is the Son of God So again, John the Baptist is calling Jesus the Son of God the Lamb of God Then if we need if we needed it one more time John chapter 3 verse 33 Whoever receives his testimony, of course, John the Baptist is talking about Jesus set his seal to this that God is true so if you if you receive John the Baptist is saying if you receive the testimony of Jesus and You are saying that God is true.

So there the first witness that Jesus brings up in this courtroom is John the Baptist who has said that Jesus is the Lamb of God that Jesus is this the Son of God that If you receive his testimony that God is true.

So John is or Jesus is saying You need a witness.

Here's John the Baptist His second witness are his works But the testimony back John chapter 5 John 5 36 But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish the very works that I am doing bear witness about me that the Father has sent me so Jesus's works are Another witness that he is from God that he is of God his works his miracles Signs and wonders are a witness that Jesus is from God We can know this because of what Nicodemus One of these religious leaders had said about Jesus He said in John 3 verse 2 rabbi we know that you are a teacher come from God For no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him So there we have the testimony of Nicodemus saying that only a person who is with God Can do these miracles signs and wonders?

So Jesus miracles prove that he is from God and of God which leads us to a question that we're not gonna get to in the weeds in because I Don't want to What are miracles?

Second question kind of off that do miracles still happen today RC Sproul which is a He Theologian pastor in just incredible work and body of ministry and brilliance as I was As I pose this question to myself and as I was studying reading learning He had just a great teaching on this and I Think the most important thing If I could distill it from RC Sproul to a bunch of different people that I was researching and looking up on this I think the important distinction that RC Sproul brought up and I think kind of speaks to both sides of the argument of if you believe miracles will happen today if you don't RC he First brought up the point we need to define what miracles are what are what are miracles and He brought up how theologians a lot of times distinguish miracles in two sort of ways in broad and a narrow aspect of miracles broad miracles meaning God's ongoing supernatural power Acted sorry God's ongoing supernatural power activity in the life of his people So that can look like the answer to our prayers The pouring out of his spirit the changing of souls and so on of course these broad miracles still happen today and then we can define miracles in the broad sense and the narrow sense and Defining miracles in the narrow sense you could define it as a miracle is the extraordinary work Performed by the immediate power of God in the external Perceivable world which is an act against nature that only God can do such as Bringing life out of death or something out of nothing I'm gonna read that narrow that narrow Definition of of miracle Again a miracle is the extraordinary work performed by the immediate power of God in the external Perceivable world which is an act against nature that only God can do such as bringing life out of death or Something out of nothing And so usually today when we hear people arguing that miracles still happen today They stop at that narrow at that narrow sense As far as bringing life out of death or something out of nothing and I think that's an important distinction as we sort of hear about miracles as we Might see miracles.

Of course God is still in control Of course God is sovereign and we're not going to get into this debate because one this isn't necessarily the right format but also I would Somewhat say it's not Completely.

It's not a salvific argument.

This argument doesn't negate or affirm salvation So we can have different conclusions on that what's the point Jesus did these near these narrow miracles Even if we turn the page to John chapter 6, he's gonna feed the thousands.

He's going to walk on water He's doing acts against nature.

He's doing again.

He will raise Lazarus from the dead, right?

He's he's Making paralyzed men completely walk again acts against nature incredible and these Works are a witness that Jesus is from God The third witness the father back to John chapter 5 verse 37 and The father who has sent me has himself born witness about me His voice you have never heard his form you have never seen and you do not have his word abiding in you For you do not believe the one whom he has sent The father has born witness about Jesus Jesus Here could be referring to his baptism Right where we get the audible word of God It records it in Matthew chapter 3 saying and behold a voice from heaven said this is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased Again, this is probably later in the timeline But God audibly spoke about Jesus at the transfiguration Matthew 17 verse 5 a bright cloud overshadowed them and a voice from the cloud said this is my beloved son with who?

I am well pleased listen to him So the father God the father gives witness about Jesus the fourth witness the scriptures verse 39 you search the scriptures because you think in them you have eternal life and It is they that bear witness about me Let's remember here.

Jesus is talking to the religious leaders He was talking to some Old Testament loving and living people and they thought that by knowing and again for our context knowing as It is in the scriptures was not just a head knowledge, but knowing meant doing So if you know it you do it They thought knowing the scriptures would earn them eternal life but Jesus is saying You are right in saying scriptures can lead to eternal life because all scripture points to me That's Jesus essentially saying all scripture points to Jesus verse 40 continues yet You refuse to come to me that you may have life The Jewish leaders read the scriptures which spoke of Jesus yet.

They refuse to give up the shadow For the reality of Jesus Christ being front and center in front of them It's like us trying to chase a rainbow thinking that there is a pot of gold at the end What is a rainbow?

Not exclusively other than well first other than a promise from God, right?

It is a reflection of light from the air It is a reflection of light in the air.

It is just a reflection.

It's not a real thing and Jesus is going I am the word all Old Testament scripture points to me You can see Jesus all Throughout Old Testament scripture even as we've been teaching the kids the last two weeks the snake crusher from Genesis chapter 3 we can see even in the beginning of Matthew of this weird family line that they highlight of of people of prostitutes of Crazy people who connect and point to Jesus If you're interested in This is a side note if you're interested in some extra listening throughout the week The white horse in podcast they just started this series on though the women in the genealogy of Jesus and They started last week it was tamar incredible story incredible discourse if you're looking for that and why these women like Rahab like tamar why they are acknowledged in the Story and in the genealogy of Jesus really cool stuff if you're interested in that but Jesus is saying I am the word I Am What the scriptures are pointing to I?

Am it and yet they refuse to come to Jesus Verse 41 I do not receive glory from people, but I know that you do not have the love of God within you Wow What a claim again Jesus talking to Pharisees religious leaders, and he's saying you don't have the love of God in you I have come verse 43 in my father's name And you do not receive me if another comes in his own name you will receive him Wow Who is the one who is deserving of all glory honor and praise?

It's Jesus and Yet the Jews would not give him that honor verse 45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the father There is one who accuses you Moses on whom you have set your hope For if you believe Moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words this portion of text?

Sort of just two things It's Jesus telling us that Moses wrote the Pentateuch.

He's saying There is one who accuses you Moses Again there he's equating Moses to the law first five books of the of the of the Bible He's saying like Moses.

It's Moses.

Those are his His words that's if you believe Moses you would believe me then Jesus is claiming here that the Jews are misinterpreting scripture since they do not believe that Jesus is the Messiah They are misinterpreting scripture because they do not understand that Jesus God Moses represented the law and The Jews hope was in fulfilling the law by their own works But if the scriptures point to Jesus then Moses the law Writes about Jesus Moses wrote about Jesus and if the Jews believed in Moses Then therefore they should have believed in Jesus and This is what Jesus is saying to these religious leaders like John the Baptist wrote is A witness of me my own works are a witness of me The father is a witness of me the scriptures and Moses are a witness of me It's no wonder they wanted to kill him like Here they are on the defense are accusing Jesus Here they are saying like who are you and then?

Jesus goes I've got my witnesses here Actually, you're the one accused.

I am NOT the one accused.

I will be the one who will go to die But even then I'll raise again But even then I'll raise again and you are going to have to wrestle with me We see in this Discourse That really Jesus was the one who was acting like the judge He was accusing them of missing him.

He accused them.

He accused them of putting their salvation in the law Not seeing Jesus as what he was a fulfillment of the law John the Baptist spoke of Jesus's divinity divinity Jesus's works showed his divinity the father confirmed Jesus as his son and all scripture points to Jesus and So if all of these things Things point to Jesus Then we ought to do the same we ought and Everything that we do Point to Jesus and again it we don't have to make it cheesy.

We don't have to make it weird Like I think it's so sweet when football players after the game they're gonna interview Just praise God my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Like it's really sweet.

It's really precious.

They've got great hearts for it And I I love that they're taking that opportunity to to make it about Jesus But like when you do something great at your work you don't have to be like Praise God Jesus.

It's all him But in everything that we do Can people see Jesus in us can can in everything that we do are we Are we allowing the fruit of the Spirit to be evident in our lives We don't make it cheesy we don't have to make it weird but We should also not be ashamed to point out how Jesus is working We should not be ashamed to point out how Jesus is the Son of God Especially in this Christmas season we must magnify the name of Christ And so if you're not the type of person to When somebody says happy holidays and you Merry Christmas, like, you know, you don't have to be that person if that's not you if that's you Great if not great But in everything that we do are we pointing people to Jesus because Jesus is the person who is worthy of all the praise all the honor all the glory if the scriptures pointed to him if John the Baptist pointed to him If his works point to him being from God and if God himself said this is my son Then we should be doing the same pointing people to Jesus Everything points to Jesus.

It's as simple as that Our lives should point people to Jesus And we should point people to Jesus And we should point people to Jesus Our lives should point people to Jesus That's all I got
