<p>Jesus prayed that we would be kept, have His joy fulfilled in us, and be sanctified and sent.</p>

## Transcription

Okay, let's turn in our Bibles this morning to John chapter 17.

We'll be looking at verses 6-19.

And we can just jump there, if somebody wants to read that for us this morning.

I can.

I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world.

Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.

Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you.

For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them, and have come to know in truth that I came from you, and they have believed that you sent me.

I am praying for them.

I am not praying for the world, but for those whom you have given me.

For they are yours.

All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.

And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you.

Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one.

While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me.

I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost, except the son of destruction, that the scripture might be fulfilled.

But now I am coming to you, and those things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one.

For they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

Sanctify them in your truth, and your word is truth.

As you sent me into the world, so have I sent them into the world.

And for their sake I consecrate myself, and for their sake I consecrate myself, that they may be sanctified in truth.

Thank you.

Have you ever read something, and you have to like read it and reread it, because it's just like so repetitive, and there's so many like yours, and mine's, and theirs, and ours, and that's kind of how this text sort of reads out, and very repetitive.

A lot of the different phrases, and so we'll try our best to decipher it all.

Let's jump back up to verse 6.

I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world.

So Jesus is saying he manifests, or he's revealed, or made known the name of God to the people who God gave Jesus out of the world.

And we can very easily sort of jump past this sentence, these words, and like just kind of like really quickly move on here.

But let's understand this.

Okay, so God's name, right?

Jesus says, I have manifested your name.

I have manifested God's name.

God's name embodies his character.

And so when Jesus says he has manifested his name to the people, he has revealed God's name is to make God's character known.

So Jesus has made God's character known in a physical body.

That's what Jesus just said.

I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of this world.

So God's name embodies his character.

And so for God to reveal God's name is to make God's characters known.

And so Jesus is making known the character of God.

We get all that in one verse.

And that's even just half the verse.

Let's continue.

Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.

Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you.

For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them.

And I've come to know in truth that I came from you, and they have believed that you sent me.

I am praying for them.

I am not praying for the world, but for those whom you have given me.

For they are yours.

All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.

And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world.

And I am coming to you, Holy Father.

Keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one.

And so Jesus is praying here for his disciples, and like we've already mentioned, it's a bit redundant.

Right?

Everything you have given me is from you.

I gave them the words you gave me.

I'm praying for them.

Not praying for the world, but praying for those who you have given me.

They are yours.

All mine are yours.

Yours are mine.

And then we get this sort of crescendo in the midst of all this, where Jesus says, Holy Father, keep them in your name, that they may be one, even as we are one.

And all of this can seem very sort of kind of secular, but what's some of the doctrine of the Trinity that we see here?

And that's, we're going to spend a moment seeing some of the doctrine of the Trinity, and then I've got something to say here.

Okay, so we have, we have the Father, and the Son, and Spirit, and all three are God.

Right?

But the Father, so the Father is God, is God.

The Son is God, the Spirit is God, but the Father is not the Son.

The Son is not the Spirit.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

There's one God, three distinct persons.

And so let me read it for you.

Or you can read it too.

So the Father is never sent in the scriptures.

We can look throughout scriptures.

The Father is never sent.

God the Father is never sent.

And is the Father incarnated?

Does he become incarnate?

Carne asada?

In meat, in flesh, right?

Incarnate?

Incarnated?

Is he incarnated like Jesus?

Or poured out at Pentecost like the Holy Spirit?

So we can see already there's these distinct pieces, this distinct part.

And the Spirit does not die on the cross.

That was Jesus for our sins.

The Father begets or creates the Son.

Sends the Son.

His only begotten Son.

His only sent Son.

Not vice versa.

And then the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son.

Right?

So we can clearly see that they each have their own different roles.

They each have their own different parts.

And we kind of, I mean, we've seen this all throughout this upper room discourse.

Jesus has spent a ton of time kind of saying, and when the Spirit comes, and then the Father, and the Son.

And so, yes, we don't get the word Trinity in Scripture.

That's a word that us mere humans created.

But we clearly see it taught in the Scripture.

And it's good that we take a moment here and see that.

And Jesus is praying that they would be one, that his disciples would be one, as all three are one in this mage-page of arrows and bad handwriting.

And there is this unity and this oneness that we see with the Father, Son, and Spirit, all three parts.

And Jesus prays that his disciples would be one.

And I think he's praying that, obviously, because he desires a oneness.

I don't think this is like, oh, like the, Jesus is waiting for every church in America to be, or every church in the world, not just America.

Sheesh, that was a slip up.

Every church in the world to be united under the exact same creed and denomination.

I don't think he's waiting for that to return.

And that's not what Jesus is talking about here.

I think he's, he's, he's talking about that, that, that oneness, that togetherness, because we can see there's different parts.

And so, yeah, there's some of us who believe in full body baptizing.

And there's some who believe in baptizing babies.

And there's great, if you've never really dug into the, those arguments, there's great arguments to be had on both sides.

And so I don't think that's what Jesus is getting at.

Um, I do think when I kind of look at it from just like, like logical, just kind of like reading it at sort of face value, when we look at what Jesus already told his disciples was going to happen for them in this upper room discourse.

So going back to John 15, uh, 14, 15.

Anyways, he says, he tells them they're going to be hated.

They're going to be persecuted.

They're going to be killed.

When those three, when those three things are in your future, division is not far behind.

If you know, hatred is coming.

If you know, persecution is coming.

If you know, killing is coming.

Then chances are you're either going to be drawn together.

Like we know they are to be come or it's going to completely destroy the whole thing.

And Jesus is here in this moment going, I pray that they would be one, like we are one.

And this, truthfully, this kind of goes even further into what is happening, but we'll get to that here in a later time.

Okay.

So verse 11 continues.

Holy father, keep them in your name, which you have given me that they may be one.

Even as we are one while I was with them.

I kept them in your name, which you have given me, I have guarded them and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction that the scripture might be fulfilled.

So Jesus calls Judas, the son of destruction to fulfill the scriptures.

What scripture do you ask?

Psalm 41, nine.

Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.

Doesn't that just that, that Psalm right there, it just, it looks and it sounds like it came straight from that upper room.

And here it is in Psalm.

It just, right?

Like Jesus goes, one of you is going to betray me.

Then Judas gets up after he established the new covenant, after they ate the bread of his body and his, and drank from the blood from the, from the wine, which represented the blood.

And then Judas gets up and he lifts his heel against him and goes to betray him.

Scripture fulfilled.

Verse 13.

But now I am coming to you and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves, that they, his disciples, may have Jesus's joy fulfilled in them.

We're going to come back to that point.

Verse 14.

Let's continue.

I have given them your word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

Sometimes I love sort of comparing and contrasting what Jesus is praying for, what Jesus is talking about here, and then what happens in the book of Acts, right?

Okay, so of course Jesus dies, raised from the dead, then we could look at Matthew 28, and we get the great commission, all authority on heaven and earth has been given to me.

So therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of Father, Son, Spirit, teaching them to observe everything I've commanded you, right?

And I will be with you until the end of the age.

I think I missed the sentence in there, but that's fine.

Then we get that reiterated in Acts 1.8, and Jesus says, you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

So their mission was to go.

Their mission was to go.

What happens in Acts chapter 2?

Spirit comes.

Peter gives the big message.

Thousands are saved.

And then a verse that we love around here, Acts 2.42, they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, to the fellowship, breaking of bread and prayer, right?

And everyone had everything in common, and they all had everything together, and they sold property and possessions, and they did all these things for each other.

And what were they doing?

They were waiting, and they were staying.

They weren't going.

They were staying.

And then, you know, Acts continues, and then they get kicked out of the synagogues, and then they're like, oh, we should probably go.

And what did Jesus pray here in this moment?

That they would not be taken out of the world.

And I think this is a struggle.

This is a struggle for the believer.

This tension of being in the world and yet being out of the world.

And yet, Jesus so clearly prays first for his disciples and then for us.

We talked about that.

It'll be verse 20.

We'll get to it that exactly next week.

But he prays for his disciples first and then for all of those who would come to know him later.

That we would go, that we would be in the world, that we would be people who gather and go.

That we would be people who come together, who lift the name of Jesus high and praise him and invite others.

And yet, we would go to wherever God has called us, to wherever God has placed us.

And this is the struggle of the believer.

This is the struggle of the early church.

It's a struggle for us today.

And yet, God has called us and he prayed that we would not be taken out of the world.

And so, this is an extra question for us this morning.

Have you taken yourself out of the world?

Do you have friends who are non-believers?

Do you have people in your life that maybe God has called you, not maybe necessarily to walk them through the Romans road.

Or to say, hey, do you believe in Jesus?

If not, you're going to hell.

No, but people in your life that you can begin to pray for, be a witness to, and show them the goodness of God through the way that you live and act.

That one's extra for you.

Jesus also prayed that they would be kept from the evil one.

Does that sound familiar?

Here, we prayed this morning, Matthew 6, 13.

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

So, not only did Jesus teach his disciples how to pray that, but here again we see Jesus praying that.

And Jesus says his disciples are not of the world.

There is a difference between those who are in Christ and those who are not in Christ.

And so, your unbeliever friends who are living and doing things that you know are wrong.

We can look at them with grace in our eyes, knowing that, yeah, they're not of Christ.

They have no conviction of, they might have some conviction of right and wrong just due to the common grace of God.

And the morality that's written on our hearts as it tells us in scripture.

But they can do whatever they want because they're not in Christ.

And so, we can look at them with grace and compassion and pray that the spirit might open their eyes and convict them.

There is a difference between those of Christ and those not of Christ.

Jesus continues to say, verse 17, So, we've got this, sanctify them in truth.

What's the truth?

The word of God is truth.

That they would be sent into the world just as Jesus was sent by God.

Jesus made himself holy so that his disciples may be like him and be sent for his purposes.

The question I want to ask us today is, What does it, what does Jesus pray for his disciples?

What does Jesus pray for his disciples?

One, that they would be kept.

That they may have Jesus' glory, Jesus' joy fulfilled in them.

That they would be sanctified and sent.

That they would be kept.

That they may have Jesus' joy fulfilled in them.

And that they would be sanctified and sent.

Let's jump into this first one.

Be kept.

Jesus prays in verse 11.

Holy Father, keep them in your name.

If you are familiar with Calvinism, A theological position that, truthfully, from my previous experience, Got a bad reputation.

But we'll save all that for another time.

At any rate, in Calvinism, there's a phrase that sort of, It's called the five points of Calvinism.

And it's an acronym.

Here we are.

Two weeks in a row.

Two different acronyms.

Sorry, no Simba this week.

But you get a tulip.

You're welcome.

So, tulip.

Let me let, I've got it here for you.

So, tulip.

You see the T.

Oh, that's an eraser.

T-U-L-I-P.

I did that last week with Simba.

I got, I got to find a new song there.

Okay, tulip.

There it is.

So, tulip.

Total depravity.

This is the idea that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

Everyone is broken.

There is total brokenness in the world.

Unconditional election.

This is essentially the idea that once saved, always saved.

That if you were saved by grace, then you've been saved by grace.

Limited atonement.

This is the idea that Christ died for those whom the Father gave him.

There is a remnant of people saved.

We can see that all throughout scripture.

We're not going to spend any more time there.

Irresistible grace.

The Holy Spirit will regenerate all those for whom Christ died.

There is grace so irresistible that through that grace you are sanctified.

There's something in you that changes, that wants to become more like God.

You want to follow in his ways.

And that grace, it is irresistible.

He is so good to us.

Of course you want to follow him.

And then, the whole reason I've brought up Calvinism and TULIP is this whole idea of perseverance of the saints.

Perseverance of the saints.

Which means, those who have been chosen by God will be kept by God.

Those who have been chosen by God will be kept by God.

And this is the whole idea of perseverance of the saints.

It's not so much about the saints striving and us working and trying to preserve ourselves.

But at what God has done to keep us.

To hold us.

I heard a preacher illustrating this point and talking about a father and a toddler.

Holding hands about to cross a busy street.

And if the safety of the toddler, the safety of the toddler on this street with cars going by.

I'm thinking of Frogger.

If the safety of that child is solely, is fully and completely on the strength and the grip of the toddler.

That toddler.

Ribbit.

Splat.

That toddler.

Most of us.

Some of us have toddlers in here.

We can recognize.

That toddler would be screwed.

But when that child is in the grip and the safety of an all-powerful, all-loving, come on somebody, father.

He is secure.

The toddler is secure.

The child is secure.

What does that mean for you and me?

We are not the grown-up in this illustration.

We are the toddler who is at one point over here and the next over there.

We are like sheep without a shepherd.

We are so lost.

We are so broken.

We are so messed up.

We cannot keep ourselves.

But when we are in the grip of our father, we are preserved.

We are kept.

Oh, come on.

We are kept.

We follow a savior who keeps us.

And what the father keeps, the son keeps.

What the son has been given comes from the father.

And you are kept by the creator of the universe.

And it is not on your own strength or your own ability to hold on tight to God, to preserve yourself to God.

And in fact, the scripture tells us he has put his spirit in us as a deposit of our inheritance.

His spirit is inside of us as a sign sealed, delivered.

He says, you are mine.

You are kept.

You are kept.

Jesus' joy fulfilled in them.

Our second point.

Back in verse 13, it says, But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

As we mentioned before, we've spent now like 11 weeks in this upper room discourse, which in reality was in a matter of hours.

And we've spent almost three months on these teachings.

And towards the beginning of the upper room discourse, John chapter 15, verse 10, Jesus says this.

If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love.

These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.

Okay, that's what he said back in chapter 15.

Let's read chapter 17 again.

I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

So we see joy here used twice.

Let me read John 15 again.

If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept the father's commandments and abide in his love.

These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.

The question is, what is the joy that Jesus is speaking of?

The joy of Jesus is keeping the commands of his father.

The joy of Jesus is keeping the commands of his father.

The author of Hebrews says it in this way.

Hebrews 12, 2.

Looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of God.

The joy set before him, the joy set before Jesus, was the thing that he was sent to do, the cross.

And he accomplished that task, and here is Jesus in this upper room.

And Jesus is praying that his disciples, and you and me today, would experience the joy of Jesus by the path of obedience.

The joy of Jesus was the commands of his father, and not just the commands, but following the commands of his father.

The joy of Jesus was, of course, the word he got, but not just receiving the word, but living the word, but doing the word, following the commands of his father.

So the question I have for us, for you, is do you view the commands of your heavenly father as joyous?

Do you view the commands of your heavenly father as joyous?

It is so hard to treat my neighbor as myself sometimes.

It is so hard to love people when they have done hard things to me, when they've stabbed me, stabbed me in the back, when they've hurt me, when they've cursed me.

It is, and do I view his commands as joyous?

Do you view the commands of your heavenly father as joyous?

For me, there is less time that I do.

I hardly do.

But I know through the power of the Spirit that he will sanctify me through his irresistible grace.

He will work in and through me that I might see his commands as joyous.

And to follow them, to experience the fullness of his joy.

Be kept.

Jesus' joy fulfilled in them.

And that they would be sanctified and sent.

Verse 17.

Sanctify them in the truth.

Your word is truth.

As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.

And for their sake, I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in the truth.

This is very interesting phrasing here.

Around both sanctification and sending.

Sanctification and sending.

It almost makes it seem like Jesus is praying that we would be sanctified so that we would be sent into the world just like Jesus.

Let me remind you what sanctification means.

Sanctification means our gradual, growing righteousness made possible by the Spirit's work in us.

So our gradual and growing righteousness made possible by the Spirit's work in us.

Do you think of your sanctification in terms of yourself?

Or that you are sanctified so that you may be sent into the world?

We are sanctified so that Jesus can send us just as the Father sent his Son.

I don't know about you, but a lot of times, and maybe this is just my millennial generation, my millennialism, but I so often view my sanctification as for me.

The Spirit is sanctifying me so that I can become more like Jesus and I can just be so close to Jesus and just be so one with Jesus and it's all for me.

But what does Jesus say here?

And for their sake, boom, there it is, verse 19.

And for their sake, so why did, why was Jesus made holy?

Why did he consecrate himself?

Not for himself.

For their sake, I consecrate myself.

That's what consecrate means set apart, to be made holy.

For their sake, I consecrate myself that they also may be sanctified in the truth.

What is Jesus saying?

Your sanctification is not for you.

Your sanctification is not for you.

And how often do I myself think I am to be made holy so I can seem holy?

Not to glorify God.

Not to make myself great, but to glorify God.

That is why we have been sanctified.

The Spirit is at work in us so that we would be sent.

Verse 17 says, Sanctify them in the truth.

Your word is truth.

And as you sent me into the world.

What does he say?

So I have sent them into the world.

Your sanctification is not for you.

Let me write it down.

Your sanctification is not for you.

You have been sanctified.

And Jesus has sent you.

Where has he sent you?

Wherever he's placed you.

Last week I got all hot and bothered about family church.

And this week I will again talk about family church.

And you guys are going to be so tired of me talking about family church.

But I, I, I, the reason I, I, I, I, I bring it up and I will keep bringing it up is because again, I am convinced.

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I your spouse, if you got one, kids in the house, if you got them, and as the leader of the home, as the man is the head of the home, so it says in scripture, it is his job to raise up and create a home of disciple making.

So how do we do that?

We pray aloud altogether.

We go over the catechism.

We read a Bible story.

Again, know your audience.

For us, we read a children's Bible.

Because we have kids.

And then we sing.

We usually sing like a chorus of one song.

It's nothing, it's nothing crazy.

We're not, like most of the time, it's just acapella.

We'll sing a chorus of a song.

And we don't care how it sounds, because it's not for us.

But we're modeling.

I'm modeling to my daughters what a husband looks like.

I'm modeling to my son what a man of God looks like.

And for me, I don't want to be a model who my kids come downstairs and they see me.

Oh, I'm just praying and I've got my Bible open and we're just sitting at the dining room table with our coffee in hand.

Like, yeah, that's a cute picture.

But I would much rather invite them into what we're doing, what I'm doing.

Why?

Because these are the people that God has placed in my care.

And so if you need help with this, if you're like, yeah, I don't, which, I've got kids.

Which children's Bible?

What does that look like?

At a senior home.

Just kidding, Grandma, you're doing a great job.

I already know that.

She's got prayer group on Monday, Bible study on Wednesday.

Crushing it.

Yeah, if you need help, if you need ideas, please come and ask.

I would love to help.

I didn't come up with this.

It's actually something the Puritans made very popular.

So, thanks for that, you Puritans.

Anyways, that's neither here nor there.

Well, it is here and there.

Jesus prayed that we would be kept.

That we would have Jesus' joy fulfilled in us.

That we would be sanctified and sent.

Wherever you've been sent, wherever God has placed you.

Why is God making you more like himself?

Not for you.

Not for you.

But so that you could be sent to your family, to your friends, to your workplace, wherever God has placed you.

And know that whatever comes your way, you will be kept by the Father.

The Spirit will help you obey the commands from the Father.

And as you are sanctified, God has sent you out.

That's what Jesus prayed that we would have and we would be.

Let me pray for us.

Father, I thank you for your word.

It is good.

It is true.

Help us to see and understand your word.

Spirit, would you convict us, mold us and shape us in your likeness.

It's in Jesus' name.
