## Transcription

If Nate didn't tell you last week, he kicked the can down the road to me.

So I'm going to speak this week.

We are in John again, going through verses 18-38 of John 13.

And we're kind of in the middle of a scene.

We're seeing as we enter into Judas' betrayal, as well as the beginning of the farewell discourse this whole time.

Jesus is preparing his disciples for his return, but for his departure.

So, if somebody would like to read John 13, 18-38.

I'm going to read John 13, right?

Yes.

I am not speaking of all of you.

I know whom I have chosen, but the scripture will be fulfilled.

He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.

I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place, you may believe that I am he.

Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.

After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.

The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.

One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at a table at Jesus' side.

So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking.

So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, Lord, who is it?

Jesus answered, It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it.

So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.

And after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him.

Jesus said to him, What you are going to do, do quickly.

Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.

Some thought that because Judas had the money back, Jesus was telling him, Buy what we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.

So that after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out, and it was night.

When he had gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.

If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once.

Little children, yet a little while I am with you.

You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, Where I am going, you cannot come.

A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another.

Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.

By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.

Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going?

Jesus answered him, Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow me afterward.

Peter said to him, Lord, why can I not follow you now?

I will lay down my life for you.

Jesus answered, Will you lay down your life for me?

Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow, but you have denied me three times.

All right.

This is a good chapter, we get two full-on Peter moments, him being a goofball.

So the context for what we just read in 13 before then was the night before the Passover, and Jesus having a meal with most likely his 12 disciples, those that are closest to him.

And we'll just dive right in.

He's in the midst of telling them that those that will do what he has commanded will then be blessed.

And he says, I am not speaking of all of you.

I know whom I have chosen, but the scripture will be fulfilled.

He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.

And it almost reads at first, he's saying that Judas wasn't chosen, but the more that you spend time, looking through the gospels, that Judas and his ministry with Jesus, that he was chosen by Jesus, we go all the way back to John 6.

It says, have I not chosen you, the 12, yet one of you is a devil.

In Luke 9, we also see that Jesus sends out the disciples, sends out the 12 that they might, I'm paraphrasing, but cast out demons and heal the sick and preach the gospel.

So we have this man that is amidst the disciples who is sent by Jesus as one of his disciples with an apostolic mission to go out and preach the gospel.

But then here we see him turn.

And there's a tendency to just see Judas as simply being the bad guy and the rest of them having kind of this strength of their own.

And you see the 11 stand firm while Judas falls, but it's not from their superior strength, it's from God choosing them, from God's grace holding them and carrying them through, which then we do see all of them in their own ways go through and actually commit treason against Jesus in these few days.

So even as a traitor is sitting at the table, Christ is in control.

You see here, he's kind of calling his shot early, saying that like this is going to happen.

He's been warning all along that there's somebody amongst him who would be a traitor.

And then this first talks about a psalm, Psalm 41.

It's verse nine, but I'll kind of give you some space around it.

So Psalm 41 verses four through 10.

As for me, I said, Oh Lord, be gracious to me.

Heal me for I have sinned against you, which is how we can see here.

This isn't directly about Jesus.

The sin has nothing to do with Christ.

My enemies say of me in malice.

When will he die and his name perish?

And when one comes to me, he utters empty words.

While his heart gathers iniquity, when he goes out, he tells it abroad.

All who hate me whisper together about me.

They imagine the worst for me.

They say a deadly thing is poured out on him.

He will not rise again from where he lies.

Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me.

But you, oh Lord, be gracious to me and raise me up that I may repay them.

So it's interesting here that Jesus is drawing a direct line to a psalm that's not necessarily a messianic psalm because it's talking about David's sin.

And it also gives us a good guide for biblical interpretation from the one who inspired the Bible.

Christ is David's greater son.

So David was always pointing forward to one who was greater than him.

And David suffers because of his, he suffers betrayal because of his sin.

Whereas we then see Christ going through suffering betrayal for our sake and for our sin.

So it's kind of flipped on his head here.

And there's a little part in there of even one who ate at my table.

This would be true of us now, but it would be even more so true then that somebody who you would have broken bread with betraying you would have been a whole nother level of betrayal.

Somebody who you broke bread with, there was almost a covenantal relationship.

But we would say it ourselves now like, I knew them.

I like, my family had them over for dinner.

So then verse 19, I'm telling you this now before it takes place that when it does take place, you may believe that I am he.

So I'd mentioned that this is this spot where Jesus starts to prepare the disciples for his death and resurrection.

And in this, it's as if he's preparing them for the few days just after a few days during all of this going on.

Because you can imagine you've got these disciples that the cross was already going to be hard for them to bear.

To see, they had pictured the Messiah in many cases being somebody who was going to take Rome or take whatever country was oppressing the Jews at that time throughout history.

But in this case, Rome.

They were expecting a conquering king to come back.

Jesus wasn't that.

He kept saying he wasn't that.

Now he's talking about suffering.

He's making all these connections to David's suffering, to the suffering servant in Isaiah.

And the cross is going to be hard to bear.

It would be even more so a destruction of their faith to then go, he had no idea that this guy that's been hanging out with us for three years is going to betray him.

So it's interesting that he's specifically saying, I'm telling you this now before it takes place that when it does, it may take place that you may believe that I am he.

So 1819, there's this interesting Christ fulfilling scripture and then Christ creating more.

Well, fulfilling prophecy and then creating more.

Um, and it is easy sometimes to, you know, we could recoil at the idea of a savior being betrayed, but to see it in that time and to see it as one of his good friends would be astounding.

Move on to verse 20.

Whoever receives the one I receive, or sorry, whoever receives the one I send receives me and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.

And there's something interesting here.

We talk about Judas having been sent by Jesus, that the work that Judas did was effectual.

So Judas did cast out demons.

He did preach the gospel that that work was true and was from God.

Judas was simply just a mouthpiece at that point.

But at this point, Jesus is starting to tie the work of his disciples to the authority of God.

And then that's how we see what happens in the New Testament, facts.

Um, and then the New Testament being written that he's sending them out and giving them authority, not just over demons, but also over preparing and sharing the word of God.

Um, verse 21 to 22.

So after saying these things, Jesus was troubled in his spirit and testified, truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.

The disciples looked at one another, uncertain upon whom he spoke.

Um, so he continues in this moment.

They're, you know, having dinner and he's just washed their feet.

And it was probably kind of weird to hear him say that somebody was going to betray him, but then for him to be here showing his humanity through being distressed, saying he was troubled, saying, truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.

And it's no longer saying like one will, or like one of you might be amongst a big group of disciples.

And how it's this small tight knit group.

And you can imagine, you know, there's 12 of us, and we all followed Jesus around and saw him cast out demons.

We've just seen him raise Lazarus from the dead, seeing him commit all these miracles.

Anything that Jesus says is going to come true.

We all know this to be true at this point.

And in the room, he's saying like, one of you will do it.

What's interesting is, as you look through the synoptics, there's this account of all of the disciples going around the room.

And it's the most humble response that Jesus says, somebody's going to betray me.

And the question isn't which, well, who is it at first?

The question is, is it me?

And they've spent, you know, three years dealing with their doubts, dealing with their fears, as again, this was not the Messiah they anticipated.

And the response that they come up with is, please don't let it be me.

Is it me?

So, yeah, they're aware of their own weakness and sin at this point.

And then we get this like strange or interesting interaction.

One of his disciples who Jesus loved was reclining a table at Jesus' side, which this then kind of expands us out to seeing what the meal actually looked like.

It would have been sitting at, probably would have been sitting at what's called a triclinium.

So it's like a U-shaped table, not dissimilar to like what we see at weddings or at Frank and Joy's wedding.

That's what they were at was the triclinium.

And in the center would be the host.

You might have an honored guest on either side.

And much has been made about the seating arrangements because, like, you know, people dive into things like this and want to know, like, who is sitting where.

It's important to remember, though, that like just a moment ago, Jesus rebuked all of the disciples for figuring out which order all of them were in.

But there was something to be said about having a place of honor.

You just couldn't ignore that.

This style of dining, they would have been not in chairs.

They would have been on the ground, leaning on their left elbow so that their right hand could be free.

It's all feels like strange detail.

But it matters because you see that one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table.

And literally there, the Greeks saying that he's reclining in his bosom.

So he's like, he's leaning into Jesus at this point.

And then in verse 25, when he's, when Peter asked John to ask him, that disciple leaning back against Jesus.

So he like literally leans into him.

He's like, kind of can snuggle in there.

And this like, it brings up a bunch of cultural differences about men being able to cuddle and not being weird.

And that just was a thing.

And as I was reading these, there was a lot of people that wanted to talk about how in the Middle East, men will just hold hands.

And it's not weird, but like, it's not appropriate for men and women to hold hands.

But that's an unimportant aside.

So they would have been sitting at this table.

And now we're seeing that John is probably really close, probably right next to Jesus.

And why do I say it's John, the disciple whom Jesus loved.

It's the first time that we see this in this gospel.

We see it throughout the rest of the gospel.

At the end of John, that disciple is, it becomes pretty clear that that's probably the guy who wrote the book.

And at the beginning, we've already kind of hashed out that we're coming from the perspective that it was probably John that wrote this.

John that was there.

And so we see he's sitting there.

And again, there's like this stunned silence, as Jesus says, one of you is going to betray me.

And as good readers of the New Testament, whenever we hear the disciples in stunned silence, you kind of assume you're about to hear Peter say something.

But we don't.

And you see this weird moment where Peter's like, so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking.

So like, we don't know where Peter was, but he's like, asking.

Who's he talking about?

And you see, so that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, Lord, who is it?

Jesus answered, it is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it.

So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.

Just a small thing here.

Him saying like, he's the son of Simon Iscariot.

If you look throughout the Gospels, there's another Judas, that's one of the disciples.

It's Judas, son of James, not the Jesus James, there's a lot of Jameses, but Judas, son of James, we mostly know him as Thaddeus, because he kind of wanted to distance himself from the Judas thing.

So Thaddeus is kind of his Christian name.

But it's, that's who, that's I think why we see Simon Iscariot mentioned there.

And what's important here is that when we look forward at verse 28, no one at the table knew why he said this to him when Jesus had told Judas to get up and leave.

So this is probably a concealed moment that John leans over and is like, who is it?

And if Jesus had said pretty loud, it's who I give this to.

And like, everybody watches, I give this to Judas.

You would have had 11 people that now knew this guy's getting up to go betray Jesus.

But here they're like, we don't know, maybe he was going to go give money to the poor or get what we need for the feast.

So it's interesting that there's this concealed moment where Jesus is confiding in John.

Maybe Peter's watching, like the way that we see Peter throughout the gospel, surely if he motioned to John, like asking, he's like watching pretty closely with bated breath.

But he says, is he whom I give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it?

Um, and what's, uh, and it's obvious that like sharing food is important.

There was something about in ancient times about like a choice morsel, the king handing a choice morsel of somebody being a way that you would honor a guest.

And we also see Jesus is handing the morsel.

And again, we've got John over on his right.

And the way that these tables are arranged, they're laying, the chances that Judas is put in the place of honor, like this is all, it's not explicit in the text.

It may be implicit, but like, who could Jesus reach over?

Um, I guess he could float it if he wanted to.

Him to be able to hand the bread to Judas means that Judas might have been put in the place of honor.

Christ is now giving him like the choiceless morsel, a friend who's giving this gesture of love to, that is the gesture that then turned Judas to move on to then betray him.

Uh, and 27, it says, then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him.

Jesus said to him, what you are going to do, do quickly.

The new King James, the way they phrased it, it is now after the piece of bread, Satan entered him.

So it is this moment that's like this trigger is Judas has now accepted the work that Satan will do.

They spoke last week about this and Judas is in no way excused for the evil that's done because Satan was involved, because he was a mouthpiece of him.

Um, it is still his sin and it is still his decision to get up and well, to some extent, his decision to get up because then we had Christ saying, get up and go.

And it's a command.

Judas has no choice but to stand up and go and betray him at that point.

Because he says, what you do, do quickly.

So it's not approval, but it's in his sovereign direction.

It's Christ taking the timetable back and setting into motion what he's been, you know, with his face set like a flint, pounding his way down to Jerusalem.

And now, even the one who would betray him, he has power over to then send.

Um, Martin Luther famously said that even the devil is God's devil.

So the work that's being done here, um, God does not do evil, but it can be ordained that he allows evil to happen.

And in reading a little bit more about Judas, there was this, you know, somebody speaking of, um, I can't remember what era he was in, but St.

Francis de Saul's, he says, there's nothing more dangerous than the habitual handling of holy things.

So that you have these disciples that spent so much time with Jesus that you can see Judas, the luster was gone in some way.

The truth of who Christ was obviously never fully sank in.

And we kind of see some of this in John 12.

We saw that John was like, when Judas was upset about Mary pouring the perfume on Jesus, he could have taken that money and give it to the poor.

And John has like no time for it.

He's like, he just said it because he wanted to like steal because he was a thief.

Like he full on just calls him a thief.

So we can see this deterioration happening with Judas, even though all the way back in John 6, Christ said there, one of you is a devil, one of you will betray me.

Um, but yeah, it is, it's beautiful and terrifying that Christ is still in control here.

Now, no one at the table knew why he said this to him.

Some thought that because Judas had the money bag.

Jesus was telling him, buy what we, what we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor.

So after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out and it was night.

And so that immediately we see throughout John, uh, when, uh, when Christ, when God, when anyone in the Godhead causes something to be done, it's done immediately.

There's no pause, there's no waiting.

So he is sent out.

And what's remarkable here is that Jesus, that Judas hit his betrayal perfectly.

He spent, again, three years with these guys.

Uh, maybe they weren't like deep.

I mean, they were all fishermen.

Many of them were fishermen before.

Um, they were just looking to hang out with some buddies or something, but for them to get completely duped by Judas is astounding.

Um, and he goes out and Judas walks with it.

Beautiful that at the end of verse 30 here says, and it was night because this is the moment when it switches that Christ's, the mechanics that Christ has put into place for his crucifixion happens.

And Judas's betrayal essentially becomes complete.

So Judas walks out from the light of the world out into utter darkness.

It was nighttime and Christ's, the beginning of the end for this little chunk of life is gone.

So when he had gone out, Jesus said, now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him.

If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and glorify him at once.

So a lot of hymns, a lot of God, uh, this, it's kind of the circle of logic of to put father in place to help it make more sense.

Now is the son of man glorified and the father is glorified in Jesus.

If God, the father is glorified in Jesus, the father will also glorify Jesus in the father's self and glorify Jesus at once.

There's this jumping back and forth.

The nut of it though is Jesus's perfect obedience, his death, his resurrection, and then his glorification is all, it's all the father and the son and the spirit wrapped up in glory.

It is all their glory.

The father having chosen with the son to send Christ in the first place.

This is his act.

The son being obedient, the father glorifying him throughout that.

There's this like cyclical Jesus saying, this is the work that is going to be done.

I just let the portrayer go.

I didn't stop him.

Um, none of us stopped him.

It's all, I forgot to mention, but it is kind of strange that John just kind of watches him go.

And maybe it's John's understanding that Jesus has a plan and his confidence in it, or maybe it's just him just being utterly stunned and not knowing what to do.

But we see that the mood kind of changes here, that now Jesus is talking to his 11 true disciples.

And then he says, little children, let a, yet a little while I'm with you, you will seek me.

And just as I said to the Jews, so now also I say to you where I'm going, you cannot come.

Um, um, I won't pretend to know Greek, but reading through here that this, the word that's used is Greek, it's technia.

And it's this tender and affectionate, the one where he's saying children.

Um, it wouldn't be an over translation to say like my dear children or darlings, but it's this really fatherly tender.

He's just cast out his traitor and then looks to these people and shows them this love and this kindness.

Passover also was this celebration that it would have been celebrated with family, not usually would have been friends and buddies.

And he's taking on this fatherly role and calling them his little children.

So you see this softness show up as he understands what they're, you know, he, he's going to go through much worse than them, but he understands what they're going to go through.

And he's starting again to try and prepare them for what's going to happen.

And where I'm going, you cannot come a new commandment.

I give you that you love one another, just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another.

So it's not, it's new.

It's not new in concept, but it's new in the way that it's shaped because we've got Deuteronomy six, five, where it says, you shall love the Lord, your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your might.

Leviticus 19, 18, you shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself.

I am the Lord.

The difference here is just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another, which in this context, just after Judas leaves is to say, as I am gone, that you not betray one another and that brotherly love be something that binds you all together.

And it's one of these little pieces that we read it amongst the Lord's Supper being instituted.

It's this new covenant.

Covenants always kind of came with commands of some sort of things that you upheld.

And this is Christ setting what the new kingdom of God would look like on earth.

By this, all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another.

Again, it's this love is the distinguishing mark for Christ's people.

And it's kind of easy and can be almost sectarian to focus on, we got to make sure that we take care of each other without thinking of those outside.

And in Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians 4.9, Paul says, now concerning brotherly love, you have no need for anyone to write to you.

For you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.

The standard is just this like, well obviously, you would care for one another and love one another, and then from there you would go out.

John, through his epistles then, just pounds this home too.

It's just like, you need to love one another.

The standard should be unbelievably high.

They just, it's, when you look back at how the disciples and apostles then start to speak about love in the New Testament, when it comes to the community of Christians, they were truly taking Christ's words for what they were, which was, this is a command.

You will do this thing because I tell you to.

But they also just had their feet washed by the man.

The example that they have is that sort of servitude.

There was a Puritan in the 1600s, Thomas Watson.

He said, love is the earmark by which Christ's sheep are known.

And in that he also warned that the devil's best music is discord.

That the place that it starts can be within a church, can be within a body of Christians.

And that the earmark, the thing that identifies us as who we are, starts with the way that we love one another.

And the more that we grasp the foot washing love of Jesus, the more that then it's sent out.

It's that the vertical fuels the horizontal.

That our understanding of Christ's love for us is the thing that then sent us out to those around us.

And this is kind of, we're entering into the beginning of what everyone calls the farewell discourse.

Jesus establishing what this new community would look like as he's about to be sent out.

Simon Peter said to him in the middle of it, Lord, where are you going?

Jesus answered him, where I'm going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow me afterward.

Christ must go to the cross alone.

This is, again, Peter's eager.

He then, in a moment, will be eager to join him.

But he, here it's like this little nugget where he's promising Peter, you cannot go with me now.

My work has not been done yet.

There is not a sacrifice lamb on the cross yet.

Once there is one, you will follow me afterward.

There's this promise to Peter that you will join me.

And then Peter says to him, Lord, why can't I not follow you now?

I will lay down my life for you.

And Jesus answered, will you lay down your life for me?

Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times.

And it's kind of normal that we see Peter overestimating his strength.

And that's also, you know, it's remarkable that Peter, Jesus is saying Peter's about to betray him.

He just said that Judas is about to betray him.

So we've got these two disciples like, well, which one, which one, why does it seem like Judas is worse when Peter's going and betraying him?

And that's, you know, for other parts of the gospels to fully take apart.

But what we see is Peter, when he does realize what he's done, that he remembers the words of Jesus and weeps.

It's repentance to the Lord.

We see Judas then, it is remorse.

It is worldly remorse when he decides that he shouldn't have done it.

He tries to give the money back to the people that he sold Jesus for, what, 30 shekels, and then goes and hangs himself in the field.

So he turns to self-destruction versus Peter giving us the example of, we all as disciples of Christ will fail and will fall short.

And the biggest, loudest, goofiest disciple that he had gives us this, you know, kind of pathetic example that a little slave girl is the one that drives him to, out of fear, deny the man that he saw in the transfiguration.

And he saw like Moses come to, this whole wild thing, like he knew exactly who Jesus was.

And to a little child, he was, was weak, broken.

And for us, we have this picture of a savior that knew that he would do that just a second ago, just called him his little child and just washed his feet.

And what that should then drive us to is that in those moments we have, we have true repentance.

When we run into the atrophy of brokenness that we come from with sin, we see that Christ did this work and that where I'm going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow me afterward.

And here we are on the other side of afterward, having seen that Christ was raised from the dead.

And it's important then to see that the thing we don't do is flee into the night like Jesus did.

Yeah.

And it does kind of end kind of quick there because it's just like, but what does it say?

Yeah.

Till you have denied me three times.

And then we're kind of left.

The next chapter, we go on to hear more about how Christ is then encouraging them.

So we see Christ go through this amidst total betrayal, Christ going through and encouraging and trying to build up his disciples so that when push came to shove and they saw that he had been betrayed, that he is on the cross, and they're all huddled in rooms, they do have something out for him.

Yeah, that's all.

That's all I got.

You don't say that anymore, so it doesn't really...

No, I'm just great.

Lord, we thank you so much that you have given us your word and that you've given us so much of it.

And you've given us, as Christians now, thousands of years of Christians spending time praying over and understanding more and more of what it means so that we all can come together and more clearly appreciate how absolute your sacrifice was and how complete our forgiveness is in you.

We thank you, Lord, that you've called us to you and that we do know you.

We ask, Lord, that you would give us strength to not lean on self-reliance, but to lean on your grace, first, foremost, and last as the thing that sustains us through failures and tribulation.

We love you, Lord, and we ask that as we go out from this church, that this week we would be lights to the world, that we would bring encouragement and hope to people, and that your word would be clearly spoken and read from our lips.

Pray this in Jesus' name.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.
