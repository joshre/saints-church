<p>In this sermon we cover chapter 12 in the book of Acts. We see continued persecution against the church and we answer the question, how do we view pain and suffering from a Biblical worldview. </p>

## Transcription

And Acts 11 ends in somewhat of a fun fashion of the church in Antioch.

Barnabas and Saul are there and there was a prophecy that came about of a famine that was coming over the land.

And so Barnabas and Saul are on their way to Jerusalem to give the elders relief to disperse amongst the church there in Jerusalem.

And once we get to chapter 12 it says about that time, so these things are happening simultaneously.

As Barnabas and Saul are on their way to Jerusalem, this is what's happening in Jerusalem.

Verse 1, The king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church.

He killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.

And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also.

This was during the days of unleavened bread.

And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.

So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.

So the text tells us here that it's Herod the king, which is true.

That was a nickname for this role, but it was actually King Agrippa I and he was really well liked by the Jews.

And here's what he did for the Jews.

He lowered taxes.

He wanted to build a wall around Jerusalem.

And his nickname was Orange Man.

Sorry, I just couldn't help myself.

That wasn't his nickname.

But the resemblance is uncanny.

But he had, at any rate, he had James, the brother of John, killed around the Passover.

And this is probably like A.

D. 41 for some of you history people, which is probably around like eight years or so after Jesus' Ascension.

But the text notes here that it pleased the Jews, which gives us a little bit of an insight into King Agrippa.

He was really well liked by the Jews, and he really liked it, and he really liked being liked.

And so the fact that he saw that it pleased the Jews to kill James, he goes, oh, well, maybe I'll get Peter then.

And so that's why he arrests Peter, because he wanted to do something nice for the Jews.

And they brought out four groups of four soldiers.

So we have 16 soldiers who are all going to arrest Peter.

And so if you could imagine, the other people in the church were freaking out, right?

Like, a bunch of soldiers go get Peter.

And you're thinking, like, he's done.

Look what they just did with James.

Like, they're going to kill him.

But how does the church respond?

Earnest prayer, it tells us in verse 5.

With earnest prayer.

Which gets me thinking, like, how are you at praying for the people in your life?

How are you at praying for the people in our church?

You know, how many times, it's so easy for us sometimes to just say we're going to pray for someone, and then not pray at all.

I wonder what would happen in our church.

I wonder what would happen in us if as needs came about and as things were being shared, if we just took a moment, hey, let's just pray right now.

And like, I wonder what would happen if that was our posture, if that was our response.

And you might be like, well, Nate, I'm just really uncomfortable praying with other people.

Good.

Do it anyways.

Verse 6.

Now when Herod was about to bring him out on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains, and centuries before the door were guarding the prison.

Okay, so this Herod the king was about to bring him out.

So what does this tell us?

It's towards the end of the Passover.

And these are the last potential moments of Peter's life.

And what does the text tell us he's doing?

Sleeping.

Which like, I can't imagine being in this circumstance and sleeping.

Like, if this was me, I'd be thinking like, what about my wife?

What about my kids?

Like, what are they going to do with the life insurance money?

Like, is Kayla going to get remarried?

Like, I would be all of these thoughts, all of this anxiety rushing through my head, all these things, and yet not Peter.

He's like, sleeping.

And not only is he sleeping, but he's sleeping, chained to two soldiers, and then there's two more soldiers outside the door.

So like, are these guys sleeping?

The text doesn't tell us if he's sleeping.

But like, just what a scene that Peter is sleeping.

But he trusted the Lord.

He was okay with death.

He was okay with what was coming, what was ahead for him.

And to quote the famous words of Queen Esther, If I perish, I perish.

And what a gift, what a joy the Christian life is.

That we have hope beyond today.

We have hope beyond this world in front of us.

We have the promise of the empty grave.

We have hope of life everlasting.

And so if death is upon us, Amen.

We get to see Jesus.

We don't have to be afraid of what is to come after this life.

If our hope, if our faith, if we believe in Jesus Christ.

Verse 7.

And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell.

He struck Peter on the side, and woke him, saying, Get up, quickly!

And the chains fell off his hands.

And the angel said to him, Dress yourself and put on your sandals.

And he did so.

And he said to him, Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.

And he went out and followed him.

He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.

When they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city.

It opened for them on its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him.

Okay, so this angel comes into the prison cell, hits Peter, is like, Wake up, dude.

Get dressed.

We're getting out of here.

It's a rescue mission.

And so he gets dressed.

And he thinks he's seeing things.

He's having a vision.

And they pass the guards.

The gate just opens into the city.

And then they go over a street.

And then Peter's like, the angel leaves him.

He's like, what's happening?

Verse 11.

When Peter came to himself, he said, Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.

So Peter comes to.

He realizes what happens and is just blown away by the protection and the rescuing of the Lord.

And so, verse 12.

When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, whose other name was Mark, where many people were gathered together and were praying.

And when he knocked on the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.

Recognizing Peter's voice in her joy, she did not open the gate, but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate.

Okay, so now Peter, he's like, Okay, I'm here.

I'm free.

I gotta go somewhere.

And so he goes to this house of Mary, which Mary must have had a big house.

So there's a lot of people and there was an outer gate.

So she must have had a party house.

And there were believers who were there praying, right?

And Peter knocks on the door and this servant girl Rhoda recognizes Peter's voice.

But like, maybe she's so excited and is just like, she's overjoyed.

So she's like, Oh my gosh, Peter!

He's here!

And doesn't unlock the door.

Leaves him standing outside.

Verse 15.

They said to her, You are out of your mind.

But she kept insisting that it was so.

And they kept saying, It is his angel.

But Peter continued knocking.

And when they opened, they saw him and were amazed.

But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.

And he said, Tell these things to James and to the brothers.

Then he departed and went to another place.

So, Rhoda goes to the people and is like, Hey, it's Peter.

He's here.

And they're like, Rhoda, you are out of your mind, girl.

And then finally, they listened to her, let him in.

They're ecstatic.

They're going crazy.

It's a party.

Shhh.

Shhh.

Shhh.

Kind of a, I'm on the hunt.

Not yet, but I will be on the hunt.

Like, God let me out of prison.

He tells them what happened.

And they're ecstatic.

And, then, Peter tells them to go, tell these things to James, which most Bible scholars believe this is the brother of Jesus.

That James, who we have his writings in our, in our Bible.

Uh, and, the brothers could mean the other elders and leaders in the Jerusalem church.

Um, and, then, Peter leaves this place.

And, after telling them the story, he gets out of town.

Which, Luke doesn't tell us why, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand why Peter got out of Jerusalem as quickly as possible.

Um, and, if you, needed more reasoning of why, verse 18.

Now, when day came, there was, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.

And, after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death.

Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there.

So, the king put out a search.

He got all the soldiers on.

He's like, we, where's Peter?

Let's go find Peter.

And, it also, the text also tells us that the soldiers were examined, which probably means they were tortured at some, to some degree.

And, then, since they failed to do their jobs, they were given the sentence that Peter was supposed to be given.

And, then, King Agrippa goes down to Caesarea and lives his life there.

Verse 20.

Now, Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord.

And, having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.

On an appointed day, Herod put on his royal robes and took his seat upon the throne and delivered an oration to them.

And, the people were shouting, the voice of a God and not of a man.

Then, immediately, an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory.

And, he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.

Some people say scripture is boring.

I don't see it.

Okay, so this portion here, we're getting a bit of history.

And, Luke's account follows very closely to what Josephus, Josephus, says, will happen.

And, Josephus, a Jewish historian around the time.

And, their accounts line up.

And, anyways, there was, we start here in verse 20, and there's some sort of rift between these free providences of Tyre and Sidon.

And, there was a disruption in their food supply chain.

And, so, they go to the king, and, they send some leaders to meet with him to strike a deal.

And, it seems like the deal, they found agreeing terms, they made a deal, and on this appointed day, as it tells us in the text, the deal was to be formalized.

And, Luke says, he put on his royal robes.

And, Josephus gives us some, some fashion details here, when he gives us the history.

And, he says he was covered in silver.

And, I'm going to quote now.

This is Josephus.

Josephus.

The silver illumined by the touch of the first rays of the sun, was wondrously radiant, and by its glitter inspired fear and awe in those who gazed intently upon it.

So, it was a really good look.

It was, it was flashy.

It was shiny.

It was, it was, he was styling.

He was balling.

Um, and the people started shouting, the voice of a god, not a voice of a man.

And, it ended quite abruptly for this king.

Josephus will describe his death as a condition that we would know now as an appendicitis.

So, the king has an appendicitis, and that's how he dies.

Um, but Luke obviously paints him, paints him as the villain, and rightfully so.

He was persecuting the church.

He killed his, his friend, and imprisoned others, and so, not a good time for the church here in this moment.

Anyways, verse 24.

But the word of God increased and multiplied, and Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, and when they had completed their service, bringing with them John, whose other's name was Mark.

So, even in the continued persecution, trials, hardship against the church, the word of God increased and multiplied.

Nothing can stop the word of God from being forwarded, from being proclaimed by Jesus' witnesses.

Christ is building his church, and the gates of hell will not stand against it.

When I look at this chapter, I, I see, yeah, we see death, persecution, we see a miraculous saving of, of Peter by an angel, and this is not the first time or first occasion in our journey through Acts, and it won't be the last, where we see persecution, trial, and hardship.

And, as, I think about this text, and, as I, think about, you know, what do we, what do we do with a text like this?

What I really want to do is, kind of take a step back, and, look at, pain and suffering, look at, hardships, and trials, um, not just in the text, but, how do we, how do we have a biblical worldview of pain and suffering?

How do we have a biblical worldview of pain and suffering?

Um, and so that's what, we're going to spend the next few moments of our, our, of our time on, is, looking at pain and suffering from a biblical worldview, and before we even get to, uh, the specifics of pain and suffering, we need to kind of even take a step back further, and since we're looking at it from a biblical perspective, we have to ask the question, who is the God of the Bible?

Who is the God of the Bible?

Then there's many ways we could discuss this, and we could spend hours talking about this, um, but what we're going to do in our time this morning, is look at two, um, different things.

Look at the communicable and incommunicable, incommunicable attributes of God. communicable meaning there are some attributes of God that have, that, that are, uh, are transferred, are, are shared with us and God.

Right?

Like a, an easy example, our love.

We understand love, we get love, um, but, never to the degree, or, or, or understanding of God.

That, that's one of the communicable attributes of God.

We have an understanding of love, but, not to the fullness and measure of God, but it is one of the attributes that God, so graciously has given to us.

And then there's the incommunicable attributes of God, which means, these are attributes that we do not understand, we do not know, we can't even fully grasp.

Right?

Like, God is all present.

We don't get, we cannot understand the idea of being everywhere, anywhere, any, every place, at the same time.

We just, yeah.

So that's an incommunicable.

We're going to look at both.

I'm not going to distinguish between which one's communicable, which ones are incommunicable.

Um, but I think you'll kind of get it.

So, um, God is, is omni, right?

God is omni, which means all or unsurpassed.

So, God is omnibenevolent, which means God is love.

I'm going to have scriptures here for each of these, and they won't be on the screen.

And, uh, I'm just going to read them out to you.

If you want the list, I can give it to you later.

Uh, omni benevolent.

First John four, eight.

Anyone who, who does not love does not know God because God is love.

So the scriptures are, are describing who is, who is the God of the Bible.

God is love is what scriptures tell us.

God is omnipresent.

Psalm 39, 139.

Where shall I go from your spirit?

Or where, where shall I flee from your presence?

If I ascend to heaven, you are there.

If I make my bed in Sheol or hell, you are there.

If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, you are there.

God is omnipresent.

He is all present.

He is always present.

God is omniscient, all intelligent, all knowing.

Psalm 147 verse 5.

Great is our Lord abundant in power.

His understanding is beyond measure.

He is all knowing.

His understanding is beyond measure.

God is omnipotent, all powerful.

Jeremiah 32, Jeremiah 32, 17.

It is you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm.

Nothing is too hard for you.

God is all powerful.

God is omnisapient or all wise.

Romans 11, 33.

Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God.

How unsearchable are His ways.

How inscrutable His ways.

God is all wise.

God is omnipotent.

He is all creating.

Colossians 1, 16.

For by Him all things were created in heaven and on earth.

Okay, God, that's who the scripture says you are.

Then what must I admit?

What must I give up?

What must I believe since I say I believe in you?

What must I understand about you then?

If God is all those things, then I have to admit that I don't know what God knows.

Isaiah 55, verse 8-9, For my thoughts are not your thoughts.

Neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord.

As for the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts, says the Lord.

I don't know what God knows.

I must also admit, I must also concede that I'm not as good as God.

Ecclesiastes 9-3.

The hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.

We're evil, we have madness in our hearts, and then we die.

That's what Ecclesiastes says.

I'm not as good as God.

I must also admit that God's plans are not flawed.

Psalm 18, 30 and 31.

This God, His way is perfect.

The word of the Lord proves true.

He is a shield for all those who take refuge in Him.

This God, His way is perfect.

The word of the Lord proves true.

I must also concede that God's values might not match mine. 1 Corinthians 1, 25.

For the foolishness of God is wiser than man, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

That's what I must concede if I'm going to worship, if I'm going to serve, if I'm going to believe in the God of the Bible.

Then what I must admit, I don't know what God knows.

I'm not as good as God.

God's plans are not flawed, and God's values do not match mine.

So whatever thing is downstream from that.

Pain and suffering.

Any issue or topic that you have or are worried about.

Anything there.

We must first admit and understand who our God is.

What that means for me in light of that.

And so when we look at pain and suffering, I don't know what God knows.

God sees the full picture.

I'm not as good as God.

Maybe my own values are flawed.

Maybe I'm looking at this from a flawed perspective, a flawed motive.

Maybe I just don't understand.

And that's a really hard place to be.

I don't understand why we're going through this.

I don't understand why I feel isolated, why I feel hurt.

It seems like I'm doing all these right things.

Like what is God?

Why?

And so then how do we respond?

How do we respond?

Our first response with these concessions, with these truths in mind.

What's my first response?
