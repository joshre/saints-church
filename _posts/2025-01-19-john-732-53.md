<p>Feast of the Booths. Jesus & the Pharisees. </p>

## Transcription

To kick off this morning, why don't we read the whole chapter of John chapter 7, so we get reacquainted with where we are, where we've been, and where we're going, I guess you could say.

Um, so John chapter 7, Jesus at the Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles, depending on which you prefer, I guess.

Somebody would like to read it.

After this, Jesus went about in Galilee.

He would not go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.

Now the Jews' Feast of Booths was at hand, so his brother said to him, Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing.

No one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly.

If you do these things, show yourself to the world.

For not even his brother's baby to him.

Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.

The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are equal.

You go up to the feast.

I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.

After saying this, he remained in Galilee.

But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, he also went up, not publicly, but in private.

The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, Where is he?

And there was much muttering about him among the people.

While some said, He is a good man, others said, No, he is leading the people astray.

Yet for fear of the Jews, no one spoke openly of him.

About the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching.

The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How is it that this man has learned, when he has never studied?

So Jesus answered them, My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.

If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God, or whether I am speaking on my own authority.

The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but the one who seeks the glory of the man who sent him is true.

And in him there is no falsehood.

Has not Moses given you the law?

Yet none of you teach the law.

Why do you seek to kill me?

And the crowd answered, You have a demon who is seeking to kill you.

Jesus answered them, I did one work, and you all marvel at it.

Moses gave you circumcision, not that it was from Moses, but from the fathers.

And you circumcised a man on the Sabbath.

If on the Sabbath the man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?

You are not judged by appearances, but judge with right judgment.

Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, Is not this the man whom they seek to kill?

And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him.

Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ?

But we know where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.

So Jesus proclaimed as he taught in the temple, You know me, and you know where I come from, but I have not come of my own accord.

He who sent me is true, and him you do not know.

I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.

So they were seeking to arrest him, but no one had a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.

Yet many of the people believed in him.

They said, When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?

The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.

Jesus then said, I will be with you a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.

You will seek me, and you will not find me.

For I am, you cannot come.

The Jews said to one another, Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him?

Does he intend to go to the dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?

What does he mean by saying, You will seek me, and you will not find me?

And where I am, you cannot come.

On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.

Whoever believes in me, as the scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.

Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive.

For as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

When they heard these words, some of the people said, This really is the prophet.

Others said, This is the Christ.

But some said, The Christ had come from Galilee.

Has not the scripture said, The Christ comes from the offspring of David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?

So there was a division among the people over him.

Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.

The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, Why did you not bring him?

The officers answered, No one ever spoke like this man.

The Pharisees answered them, Have you also been deceived?

Have any of the authorities for the Pharisees believed in him?

But this crowd that does not know the law is a curse.

Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and he was one of them, said to them, Is our law judging man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?

They replied, Are you from Galilee too?

Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee.

All right.

Thank you.

So all of this, again, is taking place at the Feast of Booths or the Feast of the Tabernacles.

I kind of like saying Tabernacles better so that I don't say the Feast of Booths.

But we see there's, as we talked about last week, there's the conversation with Jesus and his brothers, and they're unbelieving, and they want Jesus to go out and prove himself to the rest of the Jews.

And Jesus is like, No, that's not my time yet.

And then Jesus goes down to the feast anyways.

And then he finds himself teaching in the temple.

And then they kind of marvel at his teaching and he rebukes them.

And then as we sort of pick up in verse 32, the Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him.

And the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.

So the Pharisees were either there or they heard he was there and they heard he was teaching.

And they're like, Go get him, boys.

It's time.

Sick him.

And then Jesus goes on to continue teaching.

And really we see in that verse 32 through verse 36 confusion amongst the Jews about Jesus' origins, about where he's from.

And he had already told them where he came from.

And now he's telling them again he's going back to the Father.

And since they are unbelieving, they cannot get to the Father.

That's a brief summary there of those verses.

And then we jump down to verse 37 and it says, On the last day of the feast, the great day.

And it's very easy for us to brush over this part here because you would have to know the Feast of Booths or Feast of Tabernacles to understand the significance, the meaning, all the context that was happening on the last day of the feast.

It was the great day.

And this was a great ceremony where the priest would bring in essentially a golden pitcher filled with water from the pool of Salome.

And then the water was offered to God at the time of the morning sacrifice, along with the daily drink offering.

And it was a drink offering of wine.

And so the wine and the water were poured into these silver bowls and then poured out before the Lord.

And the Jews at the time thought both to the Lord's provision of the water in the desert of the Israelites as, again, going back to Moses and the striking of the rock.

And so it would have been a they would have been thinking of that and to the Lord's pouring out of the spirit in the last days.

So the pouring at the Feast of Booths, which refers symbolically to, again, this sort of messianic age in which the stream from the rock and would flow over the whole earth.

So this is kind of what they're thinking about here.

And then the text tells us that while this is happening, Jesus stood up and cried out, says right there in 37, Jesus stood up and cried out, if anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.

So there is this ceremony happening of them pouring out water, pouring out the wine.

And Jesus says, again, they're thinking of the messianic age.

They're thinking of the the callback all the way to Moses and the Israelites and the provision of the water.

And then we see all throughout the prophets.

There is this prophecy of of of water coming out of of water coming out of the temple.

Did we talk about that last week or is this this week?

Oh, we'll get there in a little bit.

So I won't get all the way there.

And.

Jesus says.

With all this water reference.

If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.

And again, it was customary for people to come from Jerusalem from all over the land.

So Jesus is standing essentially in the middle of Times Square as a as this as a celebrations are going of remembering God's provision of water in the desert and as well as the pouring out of God's spirit in these last days.

And Jesus says, if anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.

Whoever believes in me, as the scriptures, I said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.

So Jesus says out of his heart.

Well, whoever believes in me out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.

Many scriptures we can look at here in reference to what Jesus is saying.

And when he says out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.

Again, it doesn't give us an exact scripture.

And we don't we don't know exactly which scripture Jesus is referring to because there's multiple scriptures where we get this idea in this picture of living water.

And so we'll highlight a couple of them.

And.

Yeah.

So Isaiah chapter 12, verse three says, with joy, you will draw water from the well of salvation.

OK, there we go.

Water, salvation.

Cool.

Ezekiel 47.

We get this picture of the water flowing from the inner court of the temple and it flows out from the temple into Jerusalem.

And Ezekiel has this dream or this revelation where he's stepping into the water, which is flowing from the inner court.

What was in the inner court?

The presence of God.

And so it is this picture, this illusion that the presence of God is coming out from the temple and his people are stepping into it.

Um, and these aren't the only Old Testament passages that focus on water, as I said.

Um, and I'm going to highlight one more, um, because it actually is closely related to the Feast of Booths.

And so in the book of Nehemiah, they are celebrating the Feast of Booths and some Levites lead the people in prayer.

And this is what they say.

Nehemiah 9, 15 and then 19 and 20.

The again, the Levites are leading people in prayer.

And this is on the Feast of Booths.

And this is what they say.

In their hunger, you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst, you brought them water from the rock.

Because of your great compassion, you did not abandon them in the desert.

By day, the pillar of cloud did not cease to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take.

You gave your good spirit to instruct them.

You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst.

Crazy.

Hits it all there.

Feast of Booths.

Jesus is like, it's nuts.

So here we are.

Uh, we see this provision from God in bread and water and the Spirit leading and guiding the Israelites.

So, we have all that context.

First, what is Jesus saying?

Uh, simply put, believe, believe in Jesus.

You will receive the Spirit of God.

And as he told the woman at the well, you will never thirst again.

It's kind of a no-duh for us.

We're like, yeah, we get that.

We've, you kind of learn it growing up if you grew up in church or you, you kind of have this.

Understanding of, yes, we've been given the Spirit.

Acts 2.

Amazing.

Um, but given that sort of context, and if we kind of take off our 21st century lens and try to step into this first century, uh, Judaism sort of world and mindset.

Uh, you know, the temple was where you sacrificed, uh, where you went to worship and be in the presence of God.

Because the presence of God was limited to a specific place.

It was limited to the temple.

And it was for specific people.

And now Jesus is saying, if you believe in me, out of your heart will flow the presence of God.

It's not limited to a person.

It is not limited to a place.

It is accessible to all.

And it is, if you drink of me, if anyone thirsts, let him come to me, Jesus says, and drink.

Whoever believes in me, said Jesus, as the scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.

So, Jesus is saying here, essentially, I am the fulfillment of all that the food, the feast of the booths anticipated.

All this, going back to that prayer in Nehemiah, connecting it to, uh, them being, uh, hungry and God giving them bread.

Thirsty and God giving them water.

God leading them by the pillar by day and the fire by night.

The provision and the protection and the leading and the guiding of the spirit.

All of this leads up to Jesus.

If you believe in me, if you drink of me, you will have the waters for, as it said in salvation, as it said in, uh, Isaiah, you will drink from the well of salvation and you will jump into the presence of God.

You will have, you will have his spirit.

But, uh, crazy.

And, it's no wonder they wanted to arrest him, get rid of him, because if he is not the son of God, obviously this is, this is straight up blasphemy.

And, uh, so then what is the people's response?

It tells us, verse 40, when they heard these words, some of the people said, this really is the prophet.

This really is the prophet.

We've gone over this multiple times.

The prophet, again, referring to, uh, that, that there would be another like Moses.

This is the prophet.

This is the Messiah.

Others said, this is the Christ.

But some said, is the Christ to come from Galilee?

Has not the scriptures said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?

So there was a division among the people over him.

Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.

Um, so some believe, and then some question his origin.

We went over this last week, but we'll briefly, uh, let's revisit it since the Jews clearly haven't gotten over this yet.

Um, Micah 5, 2 from Bethlehem, but you, O Bethlehem, who, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah from you shall come forth for me.

One who is to be the ruler of, to be the ruler in Israel.

And then, uh, Isaiah 9, 1 through 2.

And I'm actually going to read the passage, uh, in, in Matthew, because in Matthew, uh, we get why this is important.

Because again, Matthew, his main audience, the main people he was focusing on were, uh, his audience is the Jews.

His audience is, uh, like he is proving that Jesus is from the line of David, that Jesus is the Messiah.

Um, of course, they're all sort of speaking to that, but, uh, Matthew is speaking very specifically to the Jews.

And so he's constantly referencing back to the Old Testament to prove his, uh, prove his point.

And so we'll, um, let me read this passage from Matthew where he's quoting Isaiah 9.

And leaving Nazareth, he went up and lived in Capernaum by the sea in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali.

So that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled.

The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light.

And for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death on them, a light has dawn.

So that's the quote there.

Matthew continues from that time, Jesus began to preach saying, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

So Jesus lived in Galilee to fulfill the scriptures.

And, uh, these people are missing it.

Um, and then we jumped down to verse 45.

Um, the officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees who said to them, why did you not bring him?

The officers said, yo, have you heard this man teach?

Um, no one has ever spoke like this man.

The Pharisees answered them.

Have you also been deceived?

Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him?

But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed Nicodemus who had gone to him before and who was one of them said to them, does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?

They replied, are you from Galilee to search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee?

So the officers didn't arrest him and the Pharisees are going like, Hey, you had one job, like get it done.

And, um, then the officers reply.

Yeah, but have you heard, have you heard him teach?

Have you heard him talk?

This man speaks with authority, like one we have never heard before to which the rulers then say, have you been deceived?

Do any of the Pharisees believe in him?

Since we don't believe in him, how come you are believing in him?

We can see such arrogance from the Pharisees here.

Do you, do we believe in him?

What gives you, if we don't believe in him, how could, how could you believe in him?

You must, you must not know the law.

That's what they accuse the people of.

Do you do not know the scriptures?

Um, but the crowd, again, it says, but 49, but this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.

Uh, let me finish this and then I'll make a point.

Um, this text shows us the arrogance and the insecurity of the Pharisees.

How many times had these Pharisees gone up and taught, gone up, done their job, gone up, done what they were, uh, quite probably called by God to do.

And, um, um, they're teaching the scriptures and missing the point.

They are surrounded by the word.

They are in the word.

They are constantly in the word.

And, uh, were they insecure because, uh, they keep talking about how good of a teacher Jesus is.

Were they, uh, insecure because, um, did they, I mean, like the Jews accused him.

Uh, do they, do they know something about Jesus that we don't know?

Like, do they really believe he is the Messiah and they're not telling us?

Uh, or have they just got, gotten so entitled to their own perspective, their own life, their own respect and authority that they have, uh, missed the point.

And, uh, what a, uh, what a lesson for us to learn today.

Um, and this isn't even the main point of the passage, but it just kind of stuck out to me as we've been going over this this morning of how we look, how we can look, how we can, um, puffer.

Ourself up by our knowledge, by our own, uh, understanding and belief and own, um, knowledge of the scriptures, whether it be towards an unbeliever, a newer believer, uh, like we can take on that same perspective.

And I know I have been guilty of it myself and, uh, they are completely missing the Messiah.

He is standing right there in front of them.

He is teaching right there in front of them.

And, uh, you would, you would think they see it.

And again, Nicodemus gets brought back up and I think, I think he sees it.

Um, and we don't, we don't know, uh, scripture doesn't tell us if Nicodemus came to believe in Jesus.

Uh, yeah, we don't know, but Nicodemus was at least the smart old man with humility to at least question as a Pharisee and say, uh, does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?

What a, what a humble like response in the midst of this tension, right?

They're trying to arrest Jesus.

Tensions are high.

They're frustrated with the officials and the officers because they did not arrest him.

They did not do what they asked him to do.

And then Nicodemus just, I mean, I think he's wise because he already went to Jesus.

Sure.

He did it in the dead of night because he didn't want to be accused of something else, but that's neither here nor there.

He still went to him.

And then Nicodemus amongst his peers and, uh, he says the right thing.

He questioned, he asked a question.

Another thing I think for us to learn here is when tensions are high, when, uh, things are going on, are we quick to ask a question or, uh, just give the solution or just talk or just make our point and hear Nicodemus is and says, does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does? there's some wisdom and humility and asking questions. 52.

They're applied.

Are you from Galilee too?

So essentially going like you, you like, are you not on our side?

Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee.

Hate to burst your bubble, but, uh, there was a prophet who came from Galilee and his name is Jesus.

And Jesus is from God and Jesus is God.

And Jesus made a way for us to be filled with the spirit.

Jesus was foretold in the old Testament.

Jesus fulfilled old Testament prophecy.

But what do we also see from this text?

That not all will believe.

This sort of takeaway that Jesus is God and Jesus is the Messiah.

It seems pretty clear from our, our perspective and our vantage point, but John is clearly trying to make a point and clearly trying to, uh, repeat a point.

And so my points then become repetitive because we're walking through this, but, um, I would caution us not to get complacent with how we see Jesus.

This was hard for them because of their own ideas around the Messiah and, um, sometimes culture, sometimes music, sometimes other things we put in our, in front of us, uh, they can get in the way of how we see Jesus.

Jesus did not come to fix our problems or make our life easy.

Jesus came to save us and unite us with God forever.

Does he heal us and help us today?

Why?

Of course, but that is not his only purpose.

And if you're like me, you've probably put him in that box a time or two where we have been more focused on today, on me, on what I want on my, uh, choosing of what I want.

What I would like versus seeing Jesus as who he is and, uh, seeing the, the gift of who he is and how, when we accept and believe in him, the assurance that we gain for eternity, I mean, like he just said, and like we all know, he, when we thirst of him, when we believe in him, he gives us his spirit as a sign and a seal that he is in us and with us.

And, uh, how often do I just would like this problem to be solved?

And, uh, again, not that he isn't helping us, leading us, guiding us, but I think sometimes we can, I can focus on the effect instead of worshiping the cause, cause and effect, if you didn't get that, you didn't get that.

So, uh, Jesus is Lord.

Jesus is the only savior.

Jesus makes a way for the spirit.

Jesus is the waters for salvation and the spirit.

Take a drink.

Let's close in prayer together.

Jesus, we thank you for who you are.

We thank you that you did not allow the culture and authorities and, um, allow the times to dictate who you are.

God, we thank you that the scriptures foretold of there being a wonderful counselor, a prince of peace and mighty God.

And the government will rest on your shoulders.

We thank you, Jesus, that you are above it all.

We thank you for a community and a church where we can come together and, uh, be reminded that you are above it all.

Sing songs of, of praise and worship saying that you are above it all.

And, Jesus, I'm sorry for the times where I have tried to remove you from your rightful place, where I have worshipped things that are not you.

Thank you for your grace and mercy.

That allows me to turn back to you.

Thank you, Jesus.

We thank you, Jesus, for coming to this earth, for your sacrifice, for your death, burial, and resurrection.

There is no one like you.

And we worship you.

We love you, Lord.

Thank you for this time together this morning.

And we pray these things in Jesus' name.

Amen.
