## Transcription

Let's turn to John chapter 6.

We're gonna read the whole chapter.

It's kind of a doozy.

It's a little lengthy so if somebody wants to start and then somebody else can take over or if you're so pleased to read it all yourself then get after it.

I'll start.

After this Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee which is the sea of Tiberias and a large crowd was following him.

Because they saw the signs that he was doing on the sick, Jesus went up on the mountains and there he sat down with his disciples.

Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews was at hand.

Lifting up his eyes then and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him, Jesus said to Philip, where are we to buy bread so that these people may eat?

He said this to test him for he himself knew what he would do.

Philip answered him, two hundred dinarii worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to get a little.

One of his disciples, Andrew Simon Peter, said then, there's a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish but what are they for so many?

Jesus said have the people sit down.

Now there was much grass in this place and one sat down about five thousand in number.

Jesus then took the loaves and when he had different things he distributed them to those who were seated, so also the fish as much as they wanted.

And when they had eaten their fill he told his disciples gather up the leftover fragments that nothing may be lost.

So they gathered them up and filled 12 baskets with fragments.

When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said this is indeed the prophet who has come into the world.

Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.

When evening came his disciples went down to the sea, got into a boat and started across the sea to Capernaum.

It was now dark and Jesus told Jesus had not yet come to them.

The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing.

When they had rowed about three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat and they were frightened.

But he said to them, it is I do not be afraid.

Then they were glad to take him into the boat and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.

On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone.

Other boats from Tiberius came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.

So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there nor his disciples they themselves got onto the boats and went to Capernaum seeking Jesus.

When they found him on the other side of the sea they said to him, Rabbi when did you come here?

Jesus answered them, truly truly I say to you you are seeking me not because you saw signs but because you ate your fill of the roads.

Do not work for the food that perishes but for the food that endures to each our life which the Son of Man will give to you.

For on him God the Father has set his seal.

Then they said to him what must we do to be doing the works of God?

Jesus answered them this is the work of God that you believe in him who he has sent.

So they said to him then what sign do you do that we may see and believe you?

What work do you perform?

Our fathers ate the man in the wilderness as it is written.

He gave them bread from the heaven to eat.

Jesus then said to them truly truly I say to you it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven but my father gave you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and his life to the world.

They said to him sir give us this bread always.

Jesus said to them I am the bread of life whoever comes to me shall not hunger and whoever believes in me shall not be thirsted.

But I say to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.

All that the father gives me will come to me.

Whoever comes to me I will never cast out.

For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me.

And this is the will of him who sent me that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day.

For this is the will of my father that everyone who looks on the sun and believes in him should have eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day.

So the Jews grumbled about him because he said I'm the bread that came down from heaven.

They said is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know?

How does he now say I have come down from heaven?

Jesus answered them do not grumble among yourselves no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws in and I will raise him up on the last day.

It is written in the prophets and they will all be taught by God.

Everyone who has heard and learned from the father comes to me not that anyone has seen the father except he who is from God.

He has seen the father.

Truly truly I say to you whoever believes has eternal life.

I am the bread of life.

Your fathers ate the man in the wilderness and they died.

This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die.

I am the living bread that came down from heaven.

If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever and the bread that I will give to the world is my flesh.

The Jews then disputed among themselves saying how can this man give up give us his flesh to eat?

So Jesus said to them truly truly I say to you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you.

Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day.

For my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.

Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I in him.

As the living father sent me and I live because of the father so whoever feeds on me he also will live because of me.

This is the bread that came down from heaven not like the bread the fathers ate and died.

Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.

Jesus said these things in the synagogue as he taught at Capernaum.

When many of his disciples heard it they said this is a hard saying who can listen to it but Jesus said knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this said to them do you take offense at this then what if you were to see the son of man ascending to where he is he was before it is the spirit that gives life the flesh has no help at all the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life but there are some of you who do not believe for Jesus knew from the beginning who those were from the beginning who those were who did not believe and who it was who would betray him and he said this is why I told you that no one can come to the father unless it is granted him by the father after this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with them so Jesus said to the 12 do you want to go away as well Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life and we have believed and have come to know that you are the holy one of God Jesus answered them did I not choose you the 12th and yet one of you is the devil he spoke of Judas the son of Simon the scarier for he one of the 12 was going to betray him awesome thank you C.

S.

Lewis I believe coined it the phrase uh Jesus is either lord lunatic or liar and this is one of these chapters where you can see the people the Jews around him either choosing he is either lord or he's just a flat out lunatic you just told me to eat your body you just told me to eat your flesh yeah it's like it's that's that's pretty crazy um I'm excited to go through this chapter and this morning we're actually going to do some something a little bit different because uh it's kind of it's kind of placed throughout this whole it's kind of place throughout this whole chapter um but uh this chapter and numbers chapter 11 there are a ton of parallels and so we're actually going to uh oh before we do that sorry I'm getting ahead of myself um in mark chapter six because fun thing so uh we're obviously we're looking at Jesus feeding the 5 000 obviously it's right there anyways never mind uh Jesus feeding the 5 000 this is the only miracle other than the resurrection that is in all four gospels and uh so we're going to look at mark chapter six get a little more context get a little bit of a different perspective on this miracle since it is recorded in all of them um and see what mark has to say about this so if somebody wants to read mark chapter six starting in verse 30 and you'll end in four at 44 mark six starting at verse 30 through 44 the apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught and he said to them come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest awhile for many were coming and going and they had no leisure even to eat and they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves now many saw them going and recognized them and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got their headbutts when he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd and he began to teach them many things and when it grew late his disciples came to him and said this is a desolate place and the hour is now late send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat but he answered them you give them something to eat and they said to him shall we go and buy 200 denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat and he said to them how many loaves do you have go and see and when they had found out they said five and two fish then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass so they sat down in groups by hundreds and by 50s and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people and he divided them he divided the two fish among them all and they all ate and were satisfied and they took up 12 baskets full of broken pieces and a fish and those who ate the loaves were 5,000 men awesome thank you uh so like feeding 5,000 men of course they just recorded the men that's 5,000 number is not including women and children so scholars estimate it could have been about 10,000 to 20,000 um which makes it all the more impressive with these little boys scraps like uh yeah but and we get the context that it's barley loaves and barley was one of the like cheapest flower or flowers grains and so and these fish were probably like either like sardines or some sort of dried fish probably with some olive oil probably paired nicely with a salmonella blanc but that's here nor there um so like i said all four gospels record this miracle um and i i'm i'm guessing the reason it is recorded in all four is because of the parallels to numbers chapter 11 and so uh we're going to turn to numbers 11 a lot of scripture reading today y'all um but don't don't hang in there it'll be worth it'll be worth it uh numbers 11 and uh if somebody wants to read that we're gonna 235 which i think is the whole chapter among them now the rabble that was among them had a strong craving and the people of israel also wept again and said oh that we had meat to eat we remember the fish we ate in egypt that cost nothing the cucumbers the melons the leeks the onions and the garlic but now our strength is dried up and there was nothing at all for this manna to look at now the manna was like chlorine received and its appearance was that of the delimit the people went about gathered and ground it in hand mills or beat it in orders and boil it hot to make a taste of it and the taste of it was the taste that takes faith with the world when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell with it phoenix heard the people weeping throughout their clans everyone at the door was timid and the anger of the lord blazed hotly and moses was displeased moses said to the lord why have you dealt ill with your servant and why have i not found favor in your sight that you lay the burden of all these people on me did i conceive all this people did i give them birth that you should say to me carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries a nursing child to the land that you swore to give their fathers where am i get where am i to get meat to give to all these people for they weep before me and say give us meat that we may eat i have not carried all this people alone the burden is too heavy for me if you will treat me like this kill me at once if i find favor in your sight that i may not see my wretchedness then the lord said to moses gather for me 70 men of the elders of israel whom you know to be the elder of the people and officers over them and bring them to the tent of meeting and let them take their stand there with you and i will come down and talk with you there and i will take some of the spirit that is on you and put it on them and they shall bear the burden of the people with you so that you may not bear yourself alone and say to the people consecrate yourselves for tomorrow and you shall eat meat for you have wept in a hearing of the lord saying who will give us meat to eat for it was better for us in egypt therefore the lord will give you meat and you shall eat you shall not eat just one day two days or five days or 10 days or 20 days but a whole month until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes a loathsome to you because you have rejected the lord who's among you and have wept before him saying why did we come out of egypt but moses said the people among whom i am number 600 000 on foot and you have said i will give them meat so that they eat a whole month shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them and be enough for them or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them and be enough for them and the lord said to moses is the lord's hand shortened now you shall see whether my word will come true for you or not so moses went out and told people the word of the lord and he gathered 70 men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent then the lord came down in the cloud and spoke to him and took some of the spirit that was on him and put it on the 70 elders and soon as the spirit rested on them they prophesied but they did not continue doing it now two men remained in the camp one named one named eldad another named midad and the spirit rested on them they were among those registered but they had not gone out to the tent and so they prophesied in the camp and a young man ran and told moses eldad midad are prophesying in the camp and joshua the son of nun the assistant of moses from his youth said my lord moses stop them but moses said to him are you jealous for my sake would that all the lord's people were prophets that the lord would put his spirit on them and moses and the elders of israel returned to the camp then a wind from the lord sprang up and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp about a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side around the camp and about two cubits above the ground and the people rose all day rose all that day and all night and all the next day and gathered the quail those who gathered least gathered 10 homers and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp or a needle was yet between their teeth before it was consumed the anger of the lord was kindled against the people and the lord struck down the people with a very big plague therefore the name of that place was called kilbrook hadavah because they there they buried the people who had the cradle from kilbrook hadavah the people journeyed to hazroch and they remained at hazroch awesome crazy crazy uh crazy story it's like one of those that's just crazy okay so uh let's point out a few of the parallels between john chapter 6 numbers 11 and verse 13 the first sort of parallel is the question they kind of ask is like where are we to get meat or where are we to get bread right we see this in john 6 verse 5 where it says lifting up his eyes then seeing the large crowd was coming toward him jesus said to philip where are we to buy bread so that these people may may eat then numbers 11 verse 13 where am i to get meat to give to all these people then the next sort of thing in the to point out is uh the disposition between the existing need and the available resources so john 6 7 through 9 says philip answered them 200 denarii which uh denarii was about a day's wage and so 200 days wages worth of bread when not be enough for each of them to get a little one of his disciples andrew andrew simon peter's brother said to him there is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish but what are they to so many then numbers 11 22 shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them and be enough for or shall all the fish of of the sea be gathered together for them and be enough for them so again we see this there's so many people so little resources then we get the description of mana which in the john chapter he mentions well mana john 6 31 our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness as it is written he gave them bread for hep from heaven to eat then numbers 11 7 through 9 now the manna was like coriander seed and its appearance that of uh bedelum the people went about and gathered it and ground it in hand mills or beat it in mortal in mortars and boiled it in pots and make cakes of it and the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with olive oil sounds kind of fun if you ask me then the next sort of parallel we see is the people's grumbling john 6 41 through 43 so the jews uh grumbled about him because he said i am the bread that came down from heaven they said uh it is is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how do you how does he now say i have come down from heaven then jesus answer them do not grumble among yourselves no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and i will raise him on the last day so we see this this grumbling um we also see grumbling in even the feeding of the 5000 then the reference to the eating of the meat uh oh wait i didn't sorry the people's grumbling numbers 11 1 and the people complained in the hearing of the lord about their misfortunes then john 6 51 is a reference to uh the eating of meat slash jesus as flesh which john 6 51 says i am the living bread that came down from heaven again now that we see uh and remember numbers 11 it's also counted in exodus 16 i believe um as this oh i should finish the reading i'm the living bread that came down from heaven if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever and the bread that i will give for the life for the life of the world is my flesh numbers 11 18 through 20 therefore the lord will give you meat and you shall eat you shall not eat just one day or two days or five days or 10 days or 20 days but a whole month until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you i think that's pretty funny there at the end that's just me um which then begs the uh sorry i lost my spot which now begs the question why is this connection important uh first we have to answer what is the importance of mana of course it's god provision for the freed israelites right uh he frees them from pharaoh and now they have food in a wilderness food in the desert obviously a miracle on its own but also goes to show the character of god that he provides for his people even though he's not a man of the world he's a man of the world he provides for his people even in their disobedience and grumbling so god provides then jesus provides for these people who have followed him and they are in a place where there is no provision it's not like there was a dominoes down the street like it says they were up up on the hillside and the sea galley um it is yeah it was from study and stuff it was said that it's just a pretty open and barren place and that like these people they could have been following him all the way from jerusalem um we don't know that it doesn't give us that context in any of the gospels we know that he was just in jerusalem um because that's where chapter five takes place and then chapter six starts with of john i'm talking about here uh after this so we don't know if it was you know days weeks months probably weeks we don't know but this crowd was following him for a long time and as we read in mark chapter six uh jesus had compassion on them right he felt bad for them they're following me we're in the desert we're kind of by this we're just in an undeserved place like we should feed them uh so there's there's no provision and what does jesus do he provides for them he takes a little barley loaf again a poor man's grain and takes some sardines or some dried fish and makes a feast for an army crazy um then later in john in john chapter six jesus says i am the bread of life jesus is saying i am the true provision i god provided for the Israelites in the wilderness i am more than just provision in the wilderness i am the i am the miracle i am the true provision i am the true miracle i am the bread of life when you partake of me you will not just uh eat and have your fill you will uh live forever is what jesus is saying the only response from the people to jesus in regards to this miracle was to make jesus king right it says uh let's say uh 14 6 14 through 15 when the people saw the sign that he had done they said this is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king right they see this miracle they go this is the guy this is uh the prophet so again the the jews here they wanted liberation from rome they did not want an eternal kingdom but temporal freedom they didn't want they weren't too concerned about uh eternity they wanted to be freed from rome and so then think about it jesus performs this miracle and the text tells us it's also around the Passover celebration what happened at Passover all the way back in what we're reading in exodus we're reading in exodus yes the angel of death and the blood posts and the blood of the lamb of course there's all that good stuff in there but more importantly it led to the liberation of the Israelites they were freed from Egypt so you have to think this is like the equivalent of the fourth of july this is their fourth of july Passover is their freedom celebration like pull out the fireworks let freedom ring baby merka right like this is all the patriotic vibes all the freedom vibes so the people see jesus do this and they call him again verse 14 this is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world remember when we talked about john the baptist they asked him are you elijah are you the prophet are you the next moses moses was the prophet so they say the jews are saying here this is the prophet this is him of course they're in their patriotic vibes it's Passover this we get to remember that we are a we are god's chosen people we are god's freed people that he he took us out of the the enslavement of egypt and and made a way for us through the red sea parted the red sea and they say this is indeed the prophet i'm saying this next part tongue in cheek but it's like these people were saying uh this is our donald trump make israel great again right miga drain the swamp i'm not saying donald trump is the prophet i'm not saying he is at all of any divinity i use that merely as an illustration to imagine what the buzz must have been like for these people who wanted to be freed again these people did not want to be under roman rule the people wanted liberation from rome that was on that was in the forefront that was in that was in the the main thing on their mind they were tired of paying roman tax they were tired of being enslaved in a different way sure they weren't slaves to pharaoh but through taxation through all these other rules and things like that they didn't they just wanted to be free and jesus says chapter 6 of john verse 20 26 truly truly i say to you you are seeking me not because you saw signs but because you ate your fill of the loaves your fill of the loaves for honest with ourselves there are more times and we'd probably like to admit we prefer the temporal freedom versus jesus's eternal freedom i know for me i would there are more more times where i'm focused on the temporal on whether it be having more money having more security worried about what is to come in this country in this time in this season of life more worried about the temporal things versus jesus's eternal kingdom and the eternal freedom that i have in and through jesus we remain focused on the temporal versus the eternal versus the things that are of true importance are of true importance and so let us remember jesus's rebuke to these people and receive it as our own as we have our own kingdoms we're trying to build as we have our own ideas and our own fortunes that we're worried about and as we have our own things that we're more focused on more concerns that we're worried about more stuff that just gets in the way of what truly matters most jesus said to them truly truly i say to you you are seeking me not because you saw signs which again i talked about this last week the signs were a witness to jesus's divinity his miracles were a witness to uh the fact that he is of god and from god and is god you are seeking me not because you saw signs but because you ate your fill of the loaves you're not seeking me because i am god you are seeking me because your belly was full and satisfied because you were satisfied and satisfied because you were satisfied that's all i got
