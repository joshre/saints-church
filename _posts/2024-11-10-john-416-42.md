## Transcription

Alright, let's turn to John chapter 4.

This is our second week looking at the story of Jesus and the woman at the well.

We will conclude this story this week and then carry on.

But this morning let's read John chapter 4 verse 1 all the way through 45.

If somebody wants to read that.

He had to pass through Samaria so he came to town Samaria called Sire near the field of Jacob that had given to his son Joseph.

Jacob's well was there so Jesus where he was from his journey was sitting beside the well.

It was about the sixth hour a woman from Samaria came to draw water.

Jesus said to her give me a drink for his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.

The Samaritan woman said to him how is it that you a Jew asks for a drink for me as woman of Samaria for Jews have no dealings with Samarians.

Jesus answered her if you knew the gift of God and who it was that is saying to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.

The woman said to him sir you have nothing to draw water with and the well is deep.

Where do you get that living water?

Are you greater than our father Jacob?

He gave us the well and drink from it himself as did his sons and his livestock.

Jesus said to her everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again.

The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.

The woman said to him sir give me this water so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.

Jesus said to her go call your husband and come here.

The woman answered him I have no husband.

Jesus said to her you are right in saying I have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you now have is not your husband.

What you have said is true.

The woman said to him sir I perceive that you are a prophet.

Our father worship on this mountain but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.

Jesus said to her woman believe me the hour is coming where when neither on this mountain nor Jerusalem we worship the father.

You worship what you do not know.

We worship what we know.

For salvation is from the Jews.

But the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth.

The Father is seeking such people to worship him.

God is spirit and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth.

The woman said I know that Messiah is coming, he who is called Christ.

When he comes he will tell us all things.

Jesus said to her I who speak to you and me.

Then just then his disciples came back they marveled that he was talking with a woman but no one said what do you seek or why are you talking with her.

So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people come see a man who told me that all I ever did can this be be Christ.

They went out of the town and were coming to him.

Meanwhile the disciples were urging him saying Rabbi eat.

But he said to them I have food to eat that you do not know about.

So the disciples said to one another has anyone brought him something to eat?

Jesus said to them my food is to do the will of him who sent me to accomplish his work.

Do you say there are yet four months then comes the harvest?

Look I tell you lift up your eyes and see that all the fields are white harvest.

Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life.

So the sower and reaper may rejoice together for here the saying holds true.

One sows and another reaps.

I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor.

Others have labored and you have entered into their labor.

Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony.

He told me all that I ever did so when they when the Samaritans came to him they asked him to stay with them and he stayed there two days and many more believed because of his word.

They said to the woman it is no longer because of what you said that we believe for we have heard this ourselves and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.

After the two days he departed from Galilee for Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his hometown so when he came to Galilee the Galatians welcomed him having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast for they had gone to the feast.

Awesome.

So last week we started looking at this passage just a few key takeaways.

Samaritans and Jews they hated each other and Jesus was on his way to Galilee and Galilee sort of up here Jerusalem's down here some some areas just right there in the middle and as Jesus was on his way up to Galilee the route to get there was either you either cross a river twice or you take the other route but you don't go through Samaria because as it says in the text Jews had no dealings with Samaritans they despised each other and yeah they really just hated each other and so the Samaritans and Jews couldn't stand each other then briefly as we're working our way through the text Jesus is living water and as Jesus is saying he is living water this means that Jesus is eternal life and is bringing eternal life and is giving eternal life it also Jesus is talking about the indwelling of the Spirit right you got to take this living water so it's that eternal life and the water makes you not thirst again ie the indwelling of the Spirit and so that's what is that's what Jesus is equating this living water to be and as we ended last week we found ourselves right in the middle of this conversation with Jesus and the Samaritan woman and so we'll pick up in verse 15 where she says sir give me this water so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water so right there we see her really telling what she desires she's interested in this living water but she's also interested in not having to come back to the water come back to the well which makes sense why she's going to this well at noon because it was typical that you would go to the well at in the morning or in the early morning when in the cool of the morning and here she is at noon in the heat of the day when the Sun's at its highest and she's drawing water and having to carry this big water jar back empty from her home all the way out to the well and then all the way back so that she wouldn't be around all the other towns women who were out there getting their wells she didn't have to be surrounded by the women or the women's friends of people that she had been with and and you know be around the people where maybe she's caught her been caught herself in the midst of an affair maybe your time or two with her and her five husbands and the one that she is now with is not her husband so I could imagine that she did not want to face the shame of the other women she didn't why would she be out when no one else was out and so she doesn't want to go back to that well because going to the well was showing her that she was alone was showing her and reminding her of all the wrong that she had done and so she says I want this living water but I also don't want to have to come back here to draw water.

Verse 16 Jesus said to her go call your husband and come here the woman answered him I have no husband Jesus said to her you are right in saying I have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you now have is not your husband what you have said is true nice the woman said to him sir I perceive that you are a prophet our fathers worshiped on this mountain but you say then in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship so Jesus after she says give me this water so that I don't have to be thirsty or have to come here to draw water Jesus said to her go call your husband and come back here since he'd probably like I'll show you where the living water is I'll show you I'll show you what's up and then she goes I don't have a husband and Jesus goes I know let me point out your biggest probably biggest sins if there is such thing as a big sin all sin is big but clearly she has a track record with men and then she changes the subject sir I perceive that you are a prophet because you just told me everything that I have ever did but our fathers worshiped on this mountain and you say in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship sir it seems like you've just read my mail and that's okay nice job but I don't worship in Jerusalem and you don't worship here at Mount Gerizim and so I'm like rubber you're like glue whatever you say to me bounces off me and sticks to you and Jesus responds to her in verse 21 woman believe me the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father you worship what you do not know we worship what we do know for salvation is from the Jews but the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth for the Father is seeking such people to worship him God is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth first we must recognize how gracious and kind God is to answer this woman's question Jesus clearly knows she's changing the subject Jesus clearly knows she's trying to avoid going to this place about her personal life and what does she do she changes the subject and Jesus he answers her question she brings up this whole thing about the temple and where to worship and Jesus answers her question and I think back on my own life and my own time of being a parent thus far and whenever maybe one of my children is in trouble or they've done something wrong and they are trying to talk their way out of it or trying to change the subject and I just don't give them the time of day I'm like no I'm here to punish you I'm here to give you a consequence I'm here to do I'm here to prove you right I'm here to bring the truth and in that moment well when I read this story I'm I am astounded at the patience and the also the tact of Jesus of still answering her question and that's not how I respond I get more upset I'm just trying to prove my point and then we see Jesus answer her question that's like to me it's just reminds me of how much I'm not like Jesus and how does Jesus start his response again verse 21 woman which again we got to go back a couple chapters to Jesus talking to his mom at the woman or at the at the wedding in Cana and he says to her like woman my hour is not yet come again that's not like a woman I told you it's a much so like a good old southern boy using ma'am so much more endearing and but let's break down his response the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the father you worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the Jews so Jesus is essentially saying there is a time coming where you won't worship on Mount Gerizim that's where the Samaritans worshiped and the Jews will not worship in Jerusalem in fact you Samaritans you worship what you do not know question what did the Samaritans not know they didn't know God how because they rejected his prophets and his word remember the Samaritans rejected all of the prophets all of the Psalms they rejected all of the Old Testament except the first five books of the Old Testament so Jesus is basically saying you think you are worshipping God but you are agnostic agnostic comes from the word agnosis which means without knowledge and Jesus said you worship what you do not know the Samaritans were worshipping without knowledge they were worshipping without a full knowledge of who Jesus or sorry of who God had revealed himself to be in Scripture why because they only worship they only kept the first five books of their Bible the Pentateuch and even then anytime that Jerusalem is mentioned they threw out that chunk of scripture chunk of scripture as well so they worshipped what they did not know they were without knowledge of the fullness of who God is of who God had revealed himself to be through his people so the Samaritans were worshipping without knowledge but not the Jews whose worship was based on the true knowledge of God through what he had revealed to them through scripture and what is the synopsis that Jesus gives of the Old Testament salvation is from the Jews and then Jesus continues to say but the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth for the Father is seeking such people to worship him God is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth true worshipers will not worship on your mountain on Mount Gerizim nor will they worship in Jerusalem the true worshipers worship in spirit and in truth in spirit let's break that down those two words in spirit and in truth in spirit I want to look back to an Old Testament passage to gain a little more knowledge and understanding because again when Jesus is speaking although of course he gives new revelation and new understanding of scripture he's also going to lean on the Old Testament because that was the scripture of the day that was God's revealed word to his people and so Jesus is always referencing and referring back to Old Testament that's why every seems like every week we're referencing an Old Testament passage because that's what Jesus would have referred to so um let's look to Old Testament worship and we're going to look at the prophet Jeremiah in Jeremiah chapter 7 if you want to turn their Jeremiah chapter 7 and we see the Lord speak to Jeremiah and instruct him to stand at the gate of the temple again remember what we're talking about in context here in John she referenced Mount Gerizim which was where the Samaritans worshiped and she also referenced the temple in Jerusalem which is obviously where the Jews worship and so here is this passage where Jeremiah is standing at the gate at the at the temple again the temple would later that Jeremiah standing at would yeah would be destroyed anyways they instruct him to stand at the gate of the temple and to tell the Jews that their worship had become dead outward and just for show Jeremiah 7 verse 8 the Lord is speaking to and through the prophet Jeremiah saying behold you trust in deceptive words to no avail you will steal murder commit adultery swear falsely make offerings to Baal and go after other gods that you have not known and then come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are delivered only to go on doing all these abominations has this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes behold I myself have seen it declares the Lord go now to my place that was in Shiloh where I made my name dwell at first and see what I did to it because of the evil of my people Israel and now because you have done all these things declares the Lord and when I spoke to you persistently you did not listen and when I called you you did not answer therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name and in which you trust and to the place that I gave to you and to your fathers as I did to Shiloh and I will cast you out of my sight as I cast out all your Kingsmen and all the offering and all the offspring of Ephraim and so Jeremiah as the voice of God is saying to God's people Israel you break my commands right we see a few of the commandments right there right you see you steal you murder you commit adultery you swear falsely you worship false gods and you're going after gods you put other gods before me right and then not only do you do that but then you come before me in my house and you say we are delivered you're worshiping and you're praising God only to go on doing these things against me then he says go back to the temple in Shiloh and see what it's like it was in ruins it was destroyed I'm going to make this temple that you worship they don't worship God they worship the temple right this is what he says there therefore I will do to the house this is verse 14 I will do to the house that is called by my name and in which you trust their trust was not in God their trust was in the temple their trust was in a physical building their trust was in the outward in which I trust and to the place that I gave to you and to your fathers as I did to Shiloh God is saying you put your trust in this temple and that temple is not it that's I gave that to you that was a gift that I gave to you as I did to your your ancestors at Shiloh which is in ruins and I'm going to bring to ruin this temple that's what God is saying and Jesus is saying similarly to this woman at the well you bring up your temple at Mount Gerizim I bring up you brought up my temple in Jerusalem and both of these are going to be in ruin both of these are going to be destroyed but there is a time and the time is here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth for the Father is seeking such people to worship him Jesus is pointing out your worship is false the worship that my people are doing in Jerusalem although they have a better understanding of who I am that worship falls short as well and we see that just as it was in Jeremiah and even now we see today the people of God go through the motions they recite the prayers they sing the songs but their hearts were not in it God does not desire that type of worship that's dead religion that is not in spirit and in truth we are to come with we are to come to him we are to come to God with hearts filled with the sense of awe hearts filled with reverence and adoration that's the worship that we offer it is to be a sacrifice of praise to his name Jesus is looking he is seeking people who worship him not in light of who we are but in light of who he is and what he has done that regardless of what has gone on in your week that when we come to worship him that we pour ourselves out doesn't have to be this crazy dramatic you know hands lifted maybe sometimes or falling to the ground or these this big extravagant stuff maybe it is for you that's fine but we have to not just go through the motions not just read words off of a TV but reflect on who God is what he has done and respond to that not let our current circumstances and situations dictate how we respond to God we cannot let our current circumstances impact how we respond to God we must as a sacrifice of praise it might cost you something to praise God it might be a little strenuous you might not have everything in the tank but that doesn't mean you just my house was built on you I'm standing strong on you no we have to sometimes work to worship again this isn't to earn anything this isn't to earn crowns or jewels in heaven this isn't for our salvation but sometimes we have to work past ourselves we have to work past our mental our mental strongholds to worship God like even this morning I got stuff in my head I got worries I got stuff going on that I'm thinking about and I've got to work past that to remind myself of who I'm worshipping that he is the cornerstone that although I am weak I can through his love right that's what we sang this morning that through the storms he is Lord Lord of all and so I need to worship with all that I have even if you come into this place with feeling like you're at 50% give it all to him lay it all at his feet pour out yourself before your Lord and Savior and if you can't do it here man when you get to heaven you're gonna be bummed out because we will just like there are angels and elders and creatures seeing before him now holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty they are constantly singing and praising to him and so if you don't like musicals now you're probably not gonna like them in the afterlife that's a joke but get ready get your head in the game gotta get you get you get you get your head in the game worship is to be a an offering a sacrifice of praise laying it all out for God in spirit and in truth this is a sure point because it's quite simple who is the truth Jesus what is the truth his word we must worship God in light of his son we must also worship God in light of his word we must worship God in light of his law his commands and his gospel his promise that's the truth verse 25 in response to Jesus's words the woman said to him I know that you that the I know that Messiah is coming he was called Christ when he comes he will tell us all things and Jesus said to her I who speak to you am he it's so interesting how her first response to Jesus revealing her sin she calls Jesus a prophet and now after he answers her question she can just think about the Messiah she goes like oh yeah that's a good point there's somebody who's gonna figure this all out for us and Jesus says what he I mean so far hasn't really done at least in the context he reveals himself as his true identity the Messiah to this woman this Samaritan woman again we have to we have to take a step back of the context right if we're reading through John and we see the prologue it gives us all these great things of of Jesus and then we see in John later in John chapter 1 we see John the Baptist affirm his identity behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world and Jesus doesn't go like no but he also doesn't go like yes that's me it just kind of lets it be and then chapter 2 we get to the wedding in Cana with the wine and Jesus says my hour has not yet come yet or my hour has not yet come and Jesus but then he proceeds to do the miracle and then the people who understood and were there the servers the those people knew he was he was God and then we continue on into chapter 3 and we see Nicodemus and they have this great conversation and he reveals to himself as the Son of Man but he does not yet say that he is the Messiah of course of course him saying he's the Son of Man that is attaching himself to God but we see for the first time Jesus clearly says that he is the Messiah and it's to a Samaritan woman which again the Jews and Samaritans hated each other and so if you're a Jew reading this or hearing this read you go the Messiah with Samaritans this is crazy and so Jesus reveals his divinity to her and just then his disciples came back then they marveled that he was talking with a woman but no one said what do you seek or why are you talking with her verse 28 so the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people come and see a man who told me all that I ever did can this be the Christ they went out of the town and were coming to him so we kind of see this sort of all happening now right you there's this conversation with the woman and Jesus and then his disciples are coming back just as he reveals that he is the Messiah to her and then she quickly runs away leaves her water jar what was which was the whole purpose of her going there and she leaves that and goes back into town and then the disciples see this woman run away and they're like it's weird but no one questions it in fact they actually go like verse 31 the disciples were urging him being Jesus saying rabbi eat but he said to them I have food to eat that you do not know about so the disciples said to one another has anyone brought him something to eat they're like this chick just like did he just door dash yeah he called up like Jersey Mike's like what's the deal here what's going on did she just woman bring me a sandwich Jesus thank you for that laugh Tim no no I appreciate that Jesus said to them my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work do you not say that there are yet four months then comes the harvest look I tell you lift up your eyes and see that the fields are white for harvest already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life so that sower and reaper may rejoice together for here the saying holds true one sows another reaps I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor others have labored and you have entered into their labor so the disciples again woman leaves she forgets her water jar or maybe she leaves it going whatever she leaves the water jar then the disciples are coming back up and they're like Jesus eat we bring you food and he's like I don't need eat bro I'm I have eaten that which you do not know and yeah just like I don't need this food albeit he's probably still thirsty since that's what he asked the woman for he asked her for a drink and yet again she failed huh I'm sorry woman you turned it out good in the end but he had already eaten food that his disciples did not know about and obviously he's reflecting on this conversation that he just had with the woman and he's using it to teach the disciples of course we don't know the exact timing of her leaving we it says just then so we can understand the interaction with the or the paths crossing of the women or of the woman at the well and the the disciples coming back to see Jesus but we don't know the timing of her getting to town and saying when she says like come see this man who has told me every all that I ever did could this be the messiah so we don't know the full timing but Jesus enters into this little sermonette or this teaching with the disciples and I I imagine in my head it probably wasn't as picture perfect as this but I imagine in my head as Jesus is saying uh look I tell you lift up your eyes and see that the fields are white for harvest I can imagine there's people from the town who are starting to come up and are like wanting to to hear about what this woman who was uh probably well known but not for the right reasons like there's these people coming up to the well right now to to hear from Jesus I imagine right it's just like picture perfect Jesus is like look lift up your eyes the fields are white for harvest and here come these people again they're probably not not like that we'll only know on uh the other side of of eternity but um anyways uh but then we get some more interesting words from Jesus one sows another reaps I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor others have labored and you have entered into their labor um Jesus could be referring to John the Baptist and Jesus's disciples baptizing in anon Evan could you pull up that that map um because in chapter three we see uh John the Baptist uh and Jesus they're baptizing over here in anon right and if you guys can see that uh anon's right up here samaria is this area right over here and so we could again this is totally speculation this is not bible this is like me and uh kind of taking from the people that I the commentaries that I study and learn from we could assume we could speculate that as Jesus in chapter three uh was baptizing over there with his disciples uh with John the Baptist we could assume that's the end of chapter three that maybe some people from samaria were over by anon and overheard John the Baptist and Jesus uh seeing them baptizing maybe witnessing and uh some of them maybe those people who were over there are then now coming to hear Jesus speak and again it's speculation this is not we don't know but it it could be the case they're pretty close by each other so uh maybe when Jesus is saying that uh one sows another reaps um I sent for you to reap for that for which you did not labor others have labored and you have entered into their labor maybe Jesus is referring to uh that time where John the Baptist and and Jesus and his own disciples are baptizing um well actually we know Jesus actually didn't baptize at all it was his disciples who baptized that's what it tells us at the beginning of John chapter four um and so yeah maybe when Jesus says one sows and other reaps he's referring to John the Baptist witnessing and preparing the way right that's what John the Baptist was supposed to do preparing the way for uh the kingdom of God and so maybe that's what when Jesus is saying one sows another reaps maybe that's what he's referring to uh that's speculation but nonetheless you can take the map off thank you Evan um what we do know is now and then the spirit brings people to himself it is not all our labor we have been given the opportunity to enter into the work of the father son and spirit but it is not our work that's what we do know for sure so again that's some speculation but what is the truth is that uh we enter into the work of the father son and spirit but it is not our work of saving and we simply just as the woman at the well did with these samaritans with these with her fellow townspeople she was like a beggar telling another beggar where to get bread she was like i'll just read it verse 39 many samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony he told me all that i ever did so when the samaritans came to him they asked him to stay with them and he stayed there two days and many more believed because of his word they said to the woman it is no longer because of what you said that we believe for we have now heard ourselves and we know that this is indeed the savior of the world jesus had to go through samaria that's what it says at the beginning of john chapter 4 he had to pass through samaria why because he knew what was on the other side of this encounter with this woman at the well that one she would understand and see uh one see the messiah but also experience this living water and that she would become an evangelist for him he told me all that i ever did i'm assuming she didn't have to expound on what she did the town knew the people knew she was just telling her fellow samaritans her fellow people could this be the messiah and they heard his words and they knew that this indeed is the savior of the world that's all i got
