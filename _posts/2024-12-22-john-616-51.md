## Transcription

Yeah, John six, starting verse 16, read through 51.

And yeah, then we'll, we'll break it down.

Somebody wants to read it.

When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, into a boat and started across the sea to confirm.

It was now dark and Jesus had not yet come to them.

The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing.

When they rode about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat.

And they were frightened.

He said to them, it is I do not be afraid.

Then they were glad to take them into the boat and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.

On the next day, the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.

Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.

So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boat and went to Capernaum seeking Jesus.

When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come here?

Jesus answered them.

Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the boat.

Do not work for the fill of the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you.

For on him, God the Father has set his seal.

Then they said to him, what must we do to be doing the works of God?

Jesus answered them.

This is the work of God that you believe in him when he is sent.

So they said to him, then what sign do you do that we may see and believe you?

What work do you perform?

Our fathers ate the man of the wilderness as it is written, he gave them bread from heaven.

Jesus said then said to them, truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my father gives you the true bread from heaven.

For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.

They said to him, Sir, give us this bread always.

Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life.

Whoever comes to me shall not hunger and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.

But I said to you that you have seen me, yet you do not believe.

All that the Father gives me will come to me and whoever comes to me, I will never cast out.

For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.

And this is the will of him who sent me that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.

For this is the will of my father that everyone who looks on the sun and believes in him should have eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day.

So the Jews grumbled about him because he said, I am the bread of heaven that came down from heaven.

They said, is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?

How does he now say I have come down from heaven?

Jesus answered them, do not grumble among yourselves.

No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.

And I will raise him up on the last day.

It is written in the prophets and they will all be taught by God.

Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.

Not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God.

He has seen the Father.

Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life.

I am the bread of life.

Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died.

This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat of it and not die.

I am the living bread that came down from heaven.

If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.

And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.

Awesome.

Thank you.

This morning we've got a lot of text and so we're gonna actually, nice, turned off.

Wonderful.

We're actually going to look at it together.

Let's see, yeah, can you see that?

Hopefully.

If not, pull out your reading glasses.

So let's get a little calibrated here.

So we see Jesus feeds the 5,000, which was right before this.

Then verse 16, when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, got into the boat and started to cross the sea to Capernaum.

And it was now dark because Jesus had not yet come with them.

And then the sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing.

And when they had rode about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near in the boat.

And they were frightened, but he said to them, it is I do not be afraid.

Then they were glad to take him in the boat.

And immediately the boat was at land to which they were going.

So of course, this is like really famous, Jesus walking on water.

John doesn't spend too much time on it, as we can clearly see.

Last week, we pointed out the, we compared and contrasted numbers 11 and the passages earlier in John chapter 6 with the feeding of the 5,000.

And Jesus providing the, or sorry, God providing the manna and quail with Moses.

And we kind of saw how this whole chapter kind of echoes that chapter and specifically the feeding of the 5,000.

And here we can kind of, if we're keeping in line with the Moses, comparing and contrasting Jesus as obviously a greater Moses.

Moses got a staff, part of the Red Sea, and Jesus doesn't need a staff.

He just walks on the water, getting to the other side.

So there is this kind of similarity.

We're not going to, I mean, we already gave the theological sort of implication.

Jesus is a greater Moses.

Moses was a shadow, a foreshadow of Moses.

We already talked about last week how Moses was the prophet.

That's what they labeled him as.

He is the prophet.

He is the sort of patriarch, if you will.

And they said about Jesus, is this the prophet?

Is this the next prophet?

Is this the Moses?

And of course, we would believe it was.

These people, as it says, verse 22, on the next day, the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had only been one boat there and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples.

But that his disciples had gone away alone.

Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.

So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there nor his disciples, they saw themselves, or they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum seeking Jesus.

So again, Jesus is greater than Moses.

And then the people who were there, they were like, what's going on?

Where's, where'd they go?

Jesus just made us this really nice meal.

You're not even going to say goodbye?

Like, what's up?

Not even a goodie bag or anything on our way?

What the heck?

So then when they found him on the other side, verse 25, of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come here?

And Jesus answered them, I walked.

Get it?

That was pretty bad.

I think it's kind of funny though.

He doesn't say that.

Jesus answered them, verse 26, truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill.

You are seeking me not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loads.

Again, we talked about this last week, but the signs were, the signs were, as Jesus told us in chapter five of John, the signs were a witness of God's divinity.

So the signs that Jesus performed, we can look at just here in this chapter of Jesus feeding the 5,000, which of course the counting was only of men.

So it could have been 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, lots of people, lots of people.

It could have been 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, lots and lots and lots and lots of people.

That could have been a sign of Jesus' divinity, or Jesus walking on water like they just asked him.

How did you get here?

We saw your disciples under the boat, but we saw you walk up the hill, and now how did you get here?

And Jesus just calls him out and says, you're not seeking me because you saw signs.

You're not seeking me because you think I am of the Father, I am of God.

You are seeking me because I fed you, because your tummy was full.

And then Jesus tells him in verse 27, do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you.

Okay, something interesting, I mean, not something interesting here.

We should know this, but okay, so there's food that perishes, right?

And then there's food that endures to eternal life, which who will give to you?

The Son of Man will give you the food of eternal life.

Jesus continues, for on him, God the Father has set his seal.

Then they said to him, what, oops, not that.

What must we do to be doing the works of God?

They're asking the question, okay, what do we have to do to inherit eternal life?

What do we have to do for this food that doesn't perish, but that endures to eternal life?

Again, we need to think that they were law-abiding Jews.

They were trying to earn their way to God.

They were trying to earn their approval to God by doing what he told them to do.

And Jesus goes, you're working for food that perishes.

Your works perish.

What must we do to be doing the works of God?

And Jesus answered them, this is the work of God that you believe.

Believe in who?

In him who he has sent.

Seems like pretty easy work to me.

So they said to him, verse 30, then what sign do you do that we may see and believe?

This is really funny.

What sign do you do?

Hello, you just ate the food that I gave you.

Yeah.

You're wondering how I got here.

Would you like me to levitate?

What would you like me to do?

Yeah.

What sign do you do that we may see and believe?

Did you see how they added something there?

What did Jesus say?

Okay, here's our question.

What must we do to be doing the works of God? 29, Jesus said to them, the work of God that you believe in him who he sent.

There it is.

Then they ask, do a sign so that we may see and believe.

They didn't just want to believe, they needed to see more.

What work do you perform?

Verse 31, the people continue, our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness.

As it is written, he gave them bread from heaven to eat.

I don't know how Jesus doesn't just smack him in the face and go like, you just quoted God and Moses providing for the Israelites.

And you just, I just told you the only reason you're seeking me is not for the signs, it's because you ate your fill of the loaves.

So I know you ate the food that I blessed and multiplied.

I know you ate that.

And now you're quoting, so it was clearly on their minds.

As it is written, he gave them bread from heaven to eat.

How does Jesus not smack them quite literally and go like, do you not get it?

Then Jesus said to them, verse 32, truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my father gives you the true bread from heaven.

For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.

They said to him, sir, give us this bread always.

So Jesus says, it was not Moses, sorry, Mo, who gave you the bread from heaven, but my father gives you the true bread from heaven.

For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.

Who came down from heaven?

It's Jesus.

The angels were singing.

So Moses did not provide, God did.

So God gives provision.

I hope you can read my doctor handwriting.

God gives provision.

And so God gives his son.

He came down from heaven.

For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.

They said to him, sir, give us this bread always.

Always.

Verse 35, Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life.

This is the first of I am statements that's littered all throughout the book.

This is the first of I am statements that's littered all throughout the book of John here.

We're going to break this down.

So I will stop there.

Whoever comes to me shall not hunger and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.

But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.

All that the father gives me will come to me and whoever comes to me, I will never cast out for I have come down from heaven.

Not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me.

And this is the will of him who sent me that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me.

But raise it up on the last day for this is the will of my father that everyone who looks on the sun and believes in him should have eternal life.

And I will raise him up on the last day.

This text is one of many texts which affirms the idea of predestination of God choosing his people.

And we're not going to unpack this whole idea completely right now because I don't want to.

But also because it's something clearly that Jesus taught and something that is put quite plainly in scripture and but specifically for this passage if I were to break this chunk down here quite shortly I would say the father gave Jesus those who would believe in him.

Whoever that is Jesus will not cast out.

But will raise up on the last day.

The father gave Jesus those who would believe in him.

Whoever that is Jesus will not cast out but raise up on the last day.

Verse 38 Jesus clearly says where he came from right for I have came come down from heaven.

And why not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me.

And this is the will of him who sent me that I should not that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day for this is the will of my father that everyone who looks on the sun and believes in him should have eternal life.

And I will raise him up on the last day.

If I'm summarizing this again I would say the will of God.

Sorry the will of God is eternal life to those who believe I think I spelled that wrong but it's fine in Jesus.

Sum it up there it is the will of God is eternal life to those who believe in Jesus.

Spell it was never a strong speller but I'm the one with the pen so okay. 41 so the Jews grumbled about him because he said I am the bread that came down from heaven.

So is the bread that came down from heaven. 42 they said is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know.

How does he now say I have come down from heaven.

Jesus answered them see it is a Christmas story see look we're talking.

All right Jesus answered them do not grumble among yourselves.

No one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and I will raise him up on the last day it is written in the prophets and they will be taught by God.

Everyone who has heard and learned from the father comes to me not that anyone has seen the father except he was from God he has seen the father truly truly I say to you whoever believes has eternal life I am the bread of life.

Your father's at the man in the wilderness and they died.

This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat of it and not die.

I am the living bread that came down from heaven if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.

All right so the Jews get all upset and get in a tizzy because Jesus says I am the bread that came down from heaven and then Jesus goes on to tell them you are completely missing the point of what I'm telling you.

And so Jesus says like no one can come to me unless the father who has sent me draws him and I will raise him up on the last day.

He says whoever believes in me has eternal life.

He says I am the bread of life.

He says and the bread I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.

A lot of repetition here.

Clearly John is trying to get a point across to the readers.

Clearly Jesus was getting a point across to the Jews that they were left with no answer.

They were left with no answer.

They were left with no answer.

They were left with no answer.

They were left with no answer.

They were left with no answer.

They were left with no answer.

Rest in peace.

They're gone.

They ate what God provided for them in the moment and they died.

They needed another bread.

They needed the true bread.

They needed the living bread that came down from heaven.

If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever.

He will live forever.

I don't mark that out.

Live forever.

And the bread that we eat is Jesus' flesh.

So the question I want to ask in close is what does it mean to eat Jesus' flesh?

What does it mean to eat Jesus' flesh?

Believe.

That's what the scripture told us.

That's what Jesus told us all throughout this.

Whoever believes has eternal life.

I am the bread of life.

And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.

My flesh is my flesh.

Does this mean...

I mean we can't go and find Jesus.

We cannot take a bite of his arm.

We cannot go and physically take a bite of Jesus.

And so we have to kind of take a step back and even go back to John chapter 3 where he's having a conversation with Nicodemus.

And he says, Whoever wants to be in the kingdom of God must be born again.

And Nicodemus goes, So I must get back in my mother's womb?

Jesus in his words, John in writing it down, is giving us this picture that to eat Jesus' flesh is to believe.

As one eats real bread and is satisfied, we must believe that Jesus is the son of God.

That he did come to earth.

That he did rise from the grave and is currently seated at the right hand of God.

That's belief.

So if we are believing in Jesus, believing that he is the bread of life, believing that he is the true bread that came down from heaven, what should us partaking of this bread be?

What should us partaking of this bread, partaking of Jesus, what should that do for us?

What should our belief do for us?

One, be satisfied.

When we eat real food, we become full.

Our satisfaction should come from believing in Jesus.

Jesus is enough.

His work is enough.

What must we do to be satisfied?

Jesus says, believe.

I should be satisfied.

I should also be assured.

I should be assured that Jesus, one, was who he said he was.

And by believing in what he said to believe, I should be satisfied.

One, was who he said he was, and by believing in what he said to believe in, that I am who he says I am.

I have what he says I have.

And that is eternal life.

And that he will raise me up on the last day.

That's what his word tells us.

That's what he said.

And so I can, one, be satisfied, two, be assured of it, and three, surrender everything I have to him.

Surrender.

If he is enough for me, if I can have full confidence in who he says he is, then I can trust and surrender everything that I am and I have to him.

Surrender everything.

Because it is so easy for us to fall into the trap of believing in what he says he is, because it is so easy for us to fall into the trap of is this enough?

I can fall into the trap of, did God really say?

I can fall into the trap of holding things for my own, doing things for my own, thinking things for my own.

Things for my own.

Man, what did it say in the Psalm we read this morning?

I hold my life in my hand continually.

That's where most of us stop.

The Psalm is continued, but I do not forget your law.

That's the balance.

That we, I think we, I'll speak for myself, that I wrestle with.

If I believe in Jesus, I can be satisfied, I can be assured, and I can surrender every single thing I have and that I own that I will own, that I will have, I can surrender it to him.

Knowing that one, he is in control.

One, he's already given me everything that I need.

If I If I Now I'm starting to sound like Ted Lasso.

Got to believe.

And as the one man who came up to Jesus, He says, I believe.

Help me with my unbelief.

Let me close in prayer for us.

Jesus, we thank you for who you are.

We thank you that you are good.
