## Transcription

John chapter 16.

As we roll through...we continue to roll through the book of John...let us...so we do the whole chapter...and then we will...

We will be looking at the first 15 verses this morning...but let us read the whole chapter of John 16...16.

John can legally drive now...in America...which America?

North America...

I have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away.

They will put you out of the synagogues.

Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering a service to God.

And they will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me.

But I have said these things to you...that when their hour comes you may remember that I told them to you.

I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you.

But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, where are you going?

But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.

Nevertheless, I tell you the truth.

It is to your advantage that I go away.

For if I do not go away, the helper will not come to you.

But if I go, I will send him to you.

And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment.

Concerning sin, because they do not believe in me.

Concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer.

Concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.

I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.

When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority.

But whatever he hears, he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.

He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

All that the Father has is mine.

Therefore, I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

A little while, you will see me no longer.

And again, a little while, you will see me.

So some of his disciples said to one another, what is this that he says to us, a little while, and you will not see me.

And again, a little while, and you will see me.

And because I am going to the Father, so they were saying, what does he mean by a little while?

We do not know what he is talking about.

Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, a little while, and you will not see me.

And again, a little while, and you will see me.

Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice.

You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy.

When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish for joy that a human being has been born into the world.

So also have you sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.

In that day, you will ask nothing of me.

Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.

Until now, you have asked nothing in my name.

Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.

I have said these things to you in figures of speech.

The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.

In that day, you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf.

For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.

I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father.

His disciples said, Ah, now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech.

Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you.

This is why we believe that you came from God.

Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?

Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and will leave me alone.

Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.

I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace.

In the world you will have tribulation, but take heart, I have overcome the world.

Awesome.

So, we will just jump right in here.

Verse 1, I have said these things to you to keep you from falling away.

They will put you out of synagogues.

Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God, and they will do these things because they have not known the Father nor me.

But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told them to you.

It's kind of funny here.

Earlier in John, remember Jesus would always say, the hour has not come, the hour has not come.

And then finally we turn, I can't remember which chapter, we'll actually talk about it later, so no need to get too specific.

But Jesus says, like, the hour has come.

And now he's talking about the coming hour for his disciples, right?

The coming hour where they will be killed.

And people will think they're doing a good thing by killing Jesus' disciples.

Regardless to say, Jesus says, he says these things to keep his disciples from falling away.

Anyway, Jesus said, Jesus just said in the last part of the previous chapter, remember, he says in chapter 15, to expect hatred, expect persecution.

And now he tells them why, right?

Jesus says, I'm telling you these things, because if you follow me, you will, well, follow me.

You're going to face the same things that Jesus had faced.

And they're going to kick you out of the synagogues.

And in fact, they're going to kill you.

And remember, Jesus just told them, I have chosen you.

I have appointed you to go and bear fruit.

And Jesus is essentially going like, hey, remember, I just told you these things.

And I'm telling you these things so that you won't you won't freak out when these things happen.

Remember these words that I've told you.

I told you, OK, so the disciples, they need to expect hatred and you expect persecution.

Essentially, they need to expect their whole world to get turned upside down and expect to die in the name of Jesus.

And so Jesus is like, you up for it?

We're here.

Come on, let's go.

And but again, Jesus isn't just telling his disciples.

He's telling his friends like.

You're following me.

Expect this.

And what's the response?

Well, Jesus continues to say, verse four, I did not say these things to you from the beginning because I was with you.

But now I'm going to him who sent me and none of you asked me, where are you going?

But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.

So these guys are speechless.

His disciples are speechless.

It's like these guys just got sat down by the doctor and the doctor says, you're a double cheeseburger away from a heart attack.

Like they're just like speechless.

Like.

Expect persecution.

Expect.

Hatred.

Expect to be thrown out of the synagogues expected expected to die.

All of these things like.

Sorry.

Jesus said sorrow has filled their hearts.

And.

Jesus continues.

And he also knows what's on the other side of that.

Verse seven.

Nevertheless, I tell you the truth.

It is to your advantage that I go away.

So these guys are in shock.

They are speechless.

They are in sorrow because Jesus is going away.

And now he's telling them all these things that are going to happen to them.

And.

He says, I tell you the truth.

It is to your advantage that I go away.

And they're like advantage.

Hatred.

Persecution.

Death.

Getting thrown out of the synagogue is to our advantage.

It is to your advantage that I go away.

For if I do not go away, the helper will not come to you.

But if I go, I will send him to you.

So Jesus is saying to them, there is a helper coming, but.

I have to go to the father.

Jesus has to go to the father, which I want to take a moment here to kind of.

Because if you read throughout your scriptures and maybe you've.

You've heard of different people arguing this or not, but the word the Trinity is nowhere in the Bible.

It's kind of a word that I guess we've made up, if you will.

Made up, if you will.

But here in the text, we clearly see all three parts of God working together in their own individual roles.

And I want to sort of clarify and hopefully bring about a little more knowledge for you of the Trinity.

But I first want us to look at our catechism.

So I'll read the kid version and then I'll read the OG, the the adult version, the explicit version.

Just kidding.

It's not explicit, but I feel like kid version, like, you know, kids bought anyways, whatever.

OK, so the our catechism Christ died willingly in our place to deliver us from the power and penalty of sin and bring us back to God.

That's a kid version.

The adult version.

The uncensored says, since death is the punishment for sin, Christ died willingly in our place to deliver us from the power and penalty of sin and bring us back to God.

By his substitutionary atoning death, he alone redeems us from hell and gains for us forgiveness of sin, righteousness and everlasting life.

So Jesus dies to deliver us from the power and penalty of sin, which is death.

Wages of sin is death.

But he also brings us back to God through the substitution of his death on our behalf.

Right.

The wages of sin is death.

That's what we've earned.

But the free gift of God is salvation in Christ Jesus.

Romans 6, 23.

So.

Jesus brings us to God through the substitution of his death.

He died on our place.

Our sin is paid in full, not by our works, but by his works.

On our behalf.

So Jesus's death accomplishes our redemption.

It is through Jesus's death that we can be redeemed.

It is through Jesus's death and resurrection that our redemption is possible.

That's the only reason we can be redeemed is through Jesus's death.

OK, but what about the spirit?

We're kind of talking about the spirit.

So Jesus's death accomplishes our redemption and the spirit applies our redemption.

The spirit applies our redemption.

So the spirit or Jesus accomplished it.

The spirit applied it.

OK, so it is the task of the Holy Spirit who was sent by the father and the son to apply the work of Jesus to our lives, which we don't have to look too far in this chapter to see.

Jesus actually tells us this.

Verse 13, chapter chapter 16, verse 13.

When the spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth for he will not speak on his own authority.

But whatever he hears, he will speak and he will declare to you the things that are to come.

Verse 14.

He will glorify me for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

He will take what is mine.

What is Jesus's salvation is his redemption is his and declare it to you.

The spirit will apply it to you.

He will declare it to you.

So there we go.

So through Jesus, we have redemption and the Holy Spirit applies redemption to to all who are in Jesus.

Amen.

Cool.

There we go.

A little theology lesson there for everyone.

OK, verse eight.

Jesus continues to say, and when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment concerning sin because they do not believe in me concerning righteousness because I go to the father and you will see me no longer.

Concerning judgment because the ruler of this world is judged.

So some scholars like to debate the interpretation of those few verses there, and some might be interested in that, which is great.

But for the sake of this morning, if you are interested in that, I will leave you to your own devices and you can do your own research.

Um, D.

A.

Carson, he's got some great material on that if you're interested.

Um, and I'm, he's kind of my source material for this portion here of what we'll get into.

Um, but let's just get there.

Let's just get there.

OK, so, um, Jesus says, uh, the spirit comes, he will convict the world concerning sin, righteousness and judgment.

Um, and so, uh, what we're going to do here is take a moment to look at how Jesus acted, responded concerning sin, concerning righteousness, concerning judgment.

Um, and we'll see how God is the same.

The spirit is the same.

The spirit is continuing to do what Jesus did on earth.

Uh, towards sin.

You don't have to go there in your Bibles.

I'm just going to mention John chapter three.

Uh, and you might remember the conversation that Jesus has with Nicodemus, right?

Of course we get John three 16 there for God's love the world.

It gives only son that whoever would believe in him would not perish, but I have everlasting life.

Then if we jump down at just two verses to verse 18, Jesus says, whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only son of God.

Jesus said, even here in the, this passage that we're looking at, uh, that the spirit will convict concerning sin because they do not believe in me.

Uh, when we see sin, we think of all the things we've done wrong.

But to Jesus, the biggest sin, the biggest issue is not believing in Jesus.

That is the, that's the big sin.

Jesus told, uh, Nicodemus that all the way back in John chapter three.

And so Jesus convicts concerning sin.

The antidote for sin and death is not less sin.

It's belief in Jesus.

So Jesus convicts concerning sin.

How about righteousness towards righteousness?

John chapter two, uh, Jesus cleanses the temple.

He overturns the tables and he makes up a big, big scene, but the temple was supposed to be a place of worship, a place where mainly Jew, but also Gentile could come and worship.

And the Jews turn that temple into a marketplace.

And so Jesus overturns the tables and he says, do not make my father's house, a house of trade.

So, uh, the people took the temple, God's design, God's own, uh, uh, construction.

And they turned it into a marketplace.

They turned the temple into a trade show, right?

And so Jesus is convicting towards righteousness.

What God intended for you to do, what, what Jesus, or yeah, what God intended for the Jews to do, how he set things up before Jesus.

You're not doing it.

You're not honoring it.

You're not.

That's it.

That's the action piece.

That's the piece where, uh, righteousness.

When I was in student ministry, I would, uh, sum up the word righteousness as right living.

That, so if we kind of think about it in that lens towards the temple, the Jews were not using the temple, how it was supposed to be used.

It was not, uh, right worship.

It was improper worship.

It was wrong living, if you will.

So Jesus is convicting the people.

He's bringing the temple back to what it was.

And it, and also in that text, he goes, this temple is going to be destroyed in three days.

And in three days, it'll be raised back up.

And of course he was talking about himself.

And so Jesus is going, even, even this isn't what true worship is supposed to be.

This is, this is just a, a, a portion of what worship is supposed to be.

It's supposed to be.

I will, I will do it.

I will accomplish it.

So towards righteousness, towards judgment, John 12.

Uh, these Greeks want to talk to Jesus and they ask the disciples if they can have, if they can have some time with Jesus.

And Jesus leads with the hour has come.

Ah, see, I told you it was coming up and, um, and the hour has come anyways.

Uh, John 12, 27.

Now is my soul troubled.

And what shall I say?

Father, save me from this hour.

But for this purpose, I've come to this hour.

Father, glorify your name.

Then a voice from heaven.

I have glorified it and I will glorify it again.

The crowd that stood there and heard, it said that it had thundered.

Others said, an angel has spoken to him.

Jesus answered, this voice has come for your sake, not mine.

Now is the judgment of the world.

Now the ruler of this world be cast out.

So the ruler of this world, Satan, the enemy, he is judged.

And now is the judgment of this world.

And now will the ruler of this world be cast out.

Jesus, another time at the feast of booths, uh, says in John chapter seven to the Pharisees, do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.

So the Pharisees were judging falsely and Jesus accused and convicted them of judging falsely.

Uh, and not just by his own authority, but Jesus tells us his judgment is right and true because he came from the father.

John eight, 16.

Yet, even if I do judge, my judgment is true for not, for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the father who sent me.

Um, we're going to come back to these words from Jesus, uh, here in a moment in John chapter 16.

Uh, but I just wanted to kind of show you how Jesus convicted concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.

Let's go back to the text and then, uh, we'll come on back to this passage here.

Uh, let's get, start from verse seven.

Nevertheless, I tell you the truth.

It is to your advantage that I go away for, if I do not go away, the helper will not come to you.

But if I go, I will send him to you.

And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment concerning sin, because they do not believe in me concerning righteousness, because I go to the father and you will see me.

And you will see me no longer concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.

Twelve.

I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.

When the spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak on his own authority.

But whatever he hears, he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.

He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

All that the father has is mine.

Therefore, I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

So Jesus tells his disciples, I've got more to share with you.

But just like the last few moments of this message, it was like drinking through a fire hose.

There was a lot, a lot of different stuff, information overload.

But Jesus tells them, verse 13, when the spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth.

He will, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears, he will speak and he will declare to you, to you the things that are to come.

So Jesus tells these men that the spirit is coming, and he will guide them to all truth.

And just as Jesus spoke on authority of God the Father, so will the spirit speak on authority of Jesus and the Father.

Then verse 14, he will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

All that the Father has is mine, therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

Whatever the spirit did then, and is doing now, will glorify Jesus.

Verse 14, he will glorify me.

Just as God, or sorry, just as Jesus glorified the Father.

The Spirit will glorify Jesus.

Okay, so as we've gone over these verses, I, my goal was for you to see it in its original context, for you to see how it applied to those disciples in that room then.

It's so important that when we read scripture, when we study scripture, we don't just jump to how this applies to us.

Because we are reading ancient text that was written to an ancient audience for ancient times.

And through the power of the Spirit, these words are still alive.

But we must understand them first in the original context, in the original meaning.

And that's what I was trying to do with you now this morning.

What I try to do every week.

But if we just stop there, then it can just become information and history.

And we know through the power of the Spirit that this word is alive.

It is sharper than any double-edged sword.

And so there is application for us in our lives today.

But we just can't jump to that application.

And so what I want to do in this moment is find some application for us.

And we're going to, let me read the passage again and then I'll tell you what we're going to do. 16 verse 7, I tell you the truth that it is to your advantage that I go away.

For if I do not go away, the helper will not come to you.

But if I go, I will send him to you.

And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment.

Concerning sin, because they do not believe in me.

Concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you will see me no longer.

Concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.

So, we're going to end this morning with a time of prayer.

Both corporately, all together, as well as individually.

Around, and we're going to pray around these works of the Spirit.

So, convicting, concerning sin, concerning righteousness, concerning judgment.

This is how it's going to work.

We're going to spend some time in each section.

Very, and we're going to, I'm going to ask one of you to pray.

And we'll spend some time in sin.

We'll spend some time in righteousness.

And we'll spend some time in judgment.

And one of you will lead us off, just in a brief prayer, just around sin.

And then righteousness, and then judgment.

But, just a brief prayer.

It doesn't need to be long.

Just keep it brief.

Keep it clear.

And then we'll have a moment of silence.

And that's just for you to pray individually.

Maybe just to sit and listen.

Ask the Holy Spirit to, around sin.

Hey, who, who in my life do I know that doesn't believe in you?

Would you, then you pray for that person?

And then would you pray that the Spirit would convict you to share and to be a light to that person?

So, we're going to, one of us will pray.

Then one of us, or then we'll spend some time in silence.

And then we'll move to the next subject.

And then rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.

Okay?

Concerning righteousness.

The story we looked at in John was Jesus overturning the tables.

But for this time, I want to bring to our attention, John chapter 13, verse 35.

He says, By this, all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.

Then later, John will write in 1 John, chapter 4, verse 12.

No one has ever seen God.

If we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us.

So, as we pray around righteousness, and we're asking God to, the Spirit to convict us concerning righteousness.

Let's pray in us a spirit that he would convict us in our relationships.

It could be with your spouse, co-worker, family member, friend.

That people would know us by our love.

And that no one has ever seen God, if we love one another.

God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us.
