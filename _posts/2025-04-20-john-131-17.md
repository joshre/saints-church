## Transcription

well good morning and happy Easter to you this morning we're gonna be looking at John chapter 13 and this should be a familiar passage and in our church over the last eight months we have been walking not running not sprinting not or should I say crawling crawling through the book of John and we've been this book now for eight months and so although it is Easter that doesn't give us an excuse to jump ahead but we have a beautiful passage to see this morning and honestly it's a quite an Easter message if you ask me so John chapter 13 and we will be looking at verses 1 through 17 and so whoever reads aloud be aware 17 ends in the middle of a paragraph so whoever wants to read that for us can go on ahead and notice your ending in the middle of a paragraph.

John chapter 13 verses 1 through 17.

Now before the feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end.

During supper when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him.

Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God.

He had come from God and was going back to God rose from supper.

He laid aside his outer garments and taking a towel tied it around his waist.

Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.

He came to Simon Peter who said to him Lord do you wash my feet?

Jesus answered him what I am doing you do not understand now but afterward you will understand.

Peter said to him you shall never wash my feet.

Jesus answered him if I do not wash you you have no share with me.

Simon Peter said to him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head.

Jesus said to him the one who has bathed does not need to wash except for his feet but is completely clean.

And you are clean but not every one of you.

For he knew who was to betray him.

That was why he said not all of you are clean.

When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place he said to them do you understand what I have done for you?

Done to you.

You call me teacher and Lord and you are right for so I am.

If I then your Lord and teacher have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet.

For I have given you an example that you also should do just as I have done to you.

Truly truly I say to you a servant is not greater than his master nor is a messenger greater than the one who has sent him.

If you know these things blessed are you if you do.

Well done.

All right.

Jesus is here with his disciples and the hour has it had come.

It's here.

We are here in the final moments of Jesus and his life on earth and the hour has come.

The hour has come for his for sin and death to be conquered through Jesus's death and resurrection.

And it says in verse one Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the father having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end.

The world the word world there that John references here is important and John is going to use this word 46 times.

If you're looking at the ESV he's going to use this 46 times in the next eight chapters.

So this is a big emphasis of of the world that John is making and it's primarily used to draw a contrast between Jesus's own his disciples and the massive lost humanity.

So Jesus's is when John is using the word world or Jesus's he's writing down Jesus's words and says world he's primarily using it to draw a distinction between Jesus's Jesus's own and the mass of lost humanity.

So in verse one when he says he loved those who were in the world John is referring not to the lost world but to the newly formed people of God who believe in the Messiah and Jesus loves the ones whom the father has given to him.

And now Jesus is about to show them the full extent of his love verse two during supper when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him.

So this text can bring up lots of different questions.

A few that came to mind for me where did the devil put this into Judas's heart was Judas demon possessed.

What was actually going on here.

Those are some questions you could have thought or could be thinking or now you're thinking.

Judas's actions were incredibly demonic and evil but Judas does not get to scapegoat responsibility to Satan.

The human heart is wicked.

Jeremiah 17 9 tells us the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick.

Who can understand it.

And John's little footnote here in the second in the second verse just shows the full extent of Jesus's love for even those who would betray him.

Verse three.

Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God rose from supper.

He laid aside his outer garments and taking a towel he tied it around his waist.

Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.

So the father has given all things into Jesus's hands and in other words he's got the power.

Right.

And what does what does Jesus do choose to do with that power.

He stands up confronts Judas and says devil get out.

He doesn't do that.

Jesus takes off his jacket.

He begins to take off his clothes and actually take on the appearance of a literal servant.

Wraps a towel around his waist and starts washing his disciples feet.

This is this is outrageous.

This is like inconceivable.

The master, the rabbi, the most senior fellow would never wash feet.

In fact, it was common that Jews would not let Jewish slaves wash feet.

That's how disgusting.

That's how yucky this act was.

It was say it was even saved most of the time for Gentile slaves to wash feet.

This was a job so low that most of the time, not even a Jew could do it.

And yet here is the Jew of all Jews.

Jesus washing his disciples feet.

And of course, later on in the text, we're going to see a call from Jesus that this is an example of what we ought to do.

And most of the times that's if we're reading this passage, that's the part that sticks out to us.

Yes, we need to go be servants.

We need to serve.

We need to wash feet.

We need to all these things.

But if that's the only thing we're getting out of this text, we have completely missed the gospel.

Jesus washing the disciples feet is not merely for us to follow in his example, but Jesus is showing what he is doing by taking up the cross, by washing our sins away.

Jesus is our suffering servant, and he is here serving his people.

We are so helpless.

We are so lost.

We are, we're screwed without Jesus, flat out.

We cannot make ourselves clean.

They tried it time and time again in the Old Testament.

The Pharisees were trying their best for it.

And you and I most definitely have tried to earn and work our way to salvation.

And Jesus comes along and kneels beside us and washes our feet.

Jesus makes us clean.

How can I come to that conclusion?

We see it here in the interaction with Peter and Jesus.

I'm so glad you asked.

Verse 6.

He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?

Jesus answered him, What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.

Peter said to him, You shall never wash my feet.

Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.

Peter is completely astonished.

He's like, No, no, no, no, no, sir.

You do not wash my feet.

You do not touch my feet.

You do not.

How dare you?

How dare you take upon the look of a servant?

How dare you do that, Jesus?

And Jesus says, If you don't let me wash your feet.

If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.

Some translations there say, You have no part with me.

And in the Greek, The word that is used here is usually used in reference to an inheritance.

So Jesus uses this same word when he shares the prodigal son parable in Luke 15.

It says, Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me.

That's Luke 15.

And it is the same Greek word miros, or part, or share.

So Jesus says to Peter, If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.

You cannot share in my inheritance with me.

If I do not make you clean.

If Jesus does not make us clean.

If Jesus does not wash us.

We do not get to share in his inheritance.

Which is true.

Unless the Lamb of God has taken away a person's sins.

Unless Jesus has washed you.

You have no share with him.

You have no part with him.

Then Peter replies and says, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.

I love Peter.

He's like, well, if it's going to be like that, then like, let's go to the bathtub, right?

He's like, clean my whole body.

Jesus said to him, verse 10, The one who has bathed does not need to wash except for his feet, but is completely clean.

And you are clean, but not every one of you.

For he knew who was to betray him.

That was why he said, not all of you are clean.

It's almost as if Jesus is saying, If you have been cleansed already, if I have washed your feet, that's enough.

What I have done is enough.

You don't need to wash any further.

The cleansing work of Jesus, his foot washing, is symbolizing spiritual cleansing on the cross, is complete in itself, and therefore Peter does not need to pursue more.

What Jesus has done is enough.

The work of Jesus on the cross is enough.

That is cleansing it enough.

What Jesus is doing, what Jesus is initiating, he doesn't need to, there is nothing more.

All done.

Finito.

What Jesus has done is enough.

The work of Jesus is enough.

And as we'll see here, there is a call for more foot washing.

But the foot washing we are commanded to do is not symbolic of the cleansing of Jesus.

It's just Jesus' foot washing that is symbolic of his salvation.

We also get mention of Judas here, which is to say, no matter what kind of ritual performed, even by Jesus, can you magically become clean?

Yes, Judas was washed, but he was not cleansed.

John 6, 63, just to remind us, the words of Jesus say, it is the spirit who gives life, the flesh is no help at all.

The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life, but there are some of you who do not believe.

Then John gives us a little footnote here in verse 64.

For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.

So we already get an admission from John earlier in chapter 6 that Judas did not believe that Jesus was the Son of God.

It is belief that saves you, not a foot washing.

Back to verse 12, chapter 13.

When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, Do you understand what I have done to you?

You call me teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.

If I then, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.

For I have given you an example that you also should do just as I have done to you.

Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.

While Jesus' act was a symbol of salvation, his teaching now points his disciples on how they might imitate him.

Jesus' sacrifice is the incredible act of love that we continually remember, and that act of sacrifice cannot be repeated, but his model of self-giving love and service should be the hallmark of Christian communities.

It should be the thing that we are known for, and not just serving those we like, not just serving those who we know and love, but even serving those who would betray you, even serving those who hate you, who make fun of you, who you would rather not deal with.

Why would we serve them?

Because Jesus served us.

What do the scriptures say?

While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

We serve Jesus because he served us, because Jesus saved us.

And if we think we deserve saving, you better check yourself before you wreck yourself, because what we deserve is death.

For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is salvation in Christ Jesus.

We deserve death, but God in his mercy chose you, chose me.

God in his infinite glory saved you and has saved me.

And so Christian, we must act like our eternity is sure.

We must act like our name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life.

And how does one of those people act?

Like their Savior.

We pick up a towel to serve.

We look for ways to serve one another.

We look for ways to serve in our community.

And what does Jesus tell his disciples?

Verse 17.

If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.

I think the issue that you and I run into is we've kept ourselves in that first part of the sentence.

If you know these things.

Yeah, we know.

We know.

We know we need to go out and serve.

We know we need to be putting our enemies first, looking for the least of these.

We know these things.

But Jesus says, blessed are you if you do them. how do we get from knowing to doing?

And again, this is not to earn salvation.

This is not to make sure that our salvation is sure.

No, what Jesus has done is enough.

But Jesus tells us that this is an example.

Jesus tells us that this is the thing that his people are going to be known for and known by.

Blessed are you if you do them.

What gets in the way for you?

Is it your pride?

It's probably all pride, truthfully.

What stops us sometimes from seeing the person who's homeless?

For us, it's outside of Whole Foods. why do we just drive by?

Why have we gotten so conditioned to just driving by needs and not stopping to help?

You know, I think of the parable that Jesus told of the Good Samaritan and yet again Jesus gives us this lovely picture of what it looks like to serve.

And so often, I mean, I fall into the category of the priest, if you will, who sees and just walk by. what gets in the way of helping and serving?

Not that we need to have all of the answers, not that we're going to get it right 100% of the time.

Again, that's not what it's about.

I heard a story the other day of a pastor who was he was talking about how one day he was driving on the road and there were these two teenage girls who tire had popped and he drove by and then there was something in his gut or in his spirit that was like, I need to go help them.

But he was on his way to church for a big church volunteer sort of party gathering thing and there were 100 of their top leaders who were waiting on him and he was like, I've got this thing to do.

I've got this thing to do.

And so he doesn't stop and then he gets a little further and then that feeling is just still on his chest if he's got to go help these two kids with broken down car on the side of the road and he's like, no. turns around goes and help them.

Well, he would go on to say years later he's meeting just some people at his church and he meets this one person and they start talking and he asks like, so how come you started going to come into our church and she said, well, actually you had pulled over on the side of the road to help my daughter and her friend with their tire that was popped and they told me, you know, you got to talking with them and you told them that you were a pastor of the church down the corner and the moment that you served my kids, I knew that was a church I could be part of.

We don't know what's on the other side of our service and whether it's a group of 11 disciples who days later would run and flee because they're scared for their own lives or one disciple who would go and betray the works of our Savior.

We don't know what's on the other side of our service, but Jesus doesn't ask us to know those things.

Jesus asks us to follow in his example.

I want to end this morning with the words of Paul to the Philippian church. so if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind, do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility, count others more significant than yourselves.

Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.

Therefore, God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every other name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

Would you pray with me?

Jesus, we thank you for your sacrifice.

We thank you that we get to celebrate this Easter morning.

We get to remember how you rose from the grave and that we can be confident that our eternity is sure.

We can be confident that you were who you said you were. that you are who you say you are.

We thank you for your humility, Jesus, that you came to earth, you took upon the form of a human, even to the point of death and death on the cross. and thank you, Jesus, that you did not stay there.

That you brought peace to those who would believe in you.

Father, we thank you for your grace and your mercy, for sending your son, for being true to your promise.

And Father, as we go about and celebrate today and remember you, may joy fill our hearts, may peace fill our hearts, because of all that you have done for us.

Father, would you help us to see people, to see those in our community who we can serve, not just a church community, not just people who we like, but people who might betray us, people who might hurt us. so that we can be an example of your love, just a little example of your love.

Help us to point people back to you, Jesus.

May our works not be done in vain, not be done for us, but let them be done in two.

Glorify and obey you, our gracious Father.

We love you, and we thank you, and we praise you, and it is in Jesus' name, everyone said, Amen.

Amen.
