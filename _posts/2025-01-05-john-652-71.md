## Transcription

Hey church, good morning.

Hope you are well.

We're here and wanted to give some sort of message for those of you who are gathering together this morning.

Can't wait.

I'm praying that we'll be there next week.

But we're just gonna jump right in and not gonna waste any time so you don't have to watch me on the screen or if you're listening.

Yeah, so let's jump in.

We're in John chapter 6.

We're finishing up the chapter today.

Verses 52 through 71.

If you are live in person and you guys want to pause, read through this and yourselves and read it there and as you're gathering, that's great.

If not, I will read it now and then yeah pray for us and then we'll jump into some notes that I have on this passage.

Alright, John 6 52.

The Jews then disputed among themselves saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.

Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day.

For my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.

Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I in him.

As the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me he also will live because of me.

This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread the Father's ate and died.

Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.

Jesus said these things in the synagogue as he taught at Capernaum.

When many of his disciples heard it they said, This is a hard saying, who can listen to it?

But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, Do you take offense at this?

Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?

Is the Spirit who gives life?

It is the Spirit who gives life.

The flesh is no help at all.

The words that I have spoken to you are Spirit and life.

But there are some of you who do not believe.

For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe and who it was who would betray him.

And he said, This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the Father.

After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him.

So Jesus said to the twelve, Do you want to go away as well?

Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?

You have the words of eternal life and we have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.

Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you the twelve?

And yet one of you is a devil.

He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray him.

Let me pray for us and then got a few notes here for this text.

Jesus, we thank you for this time where we can open up your word and receive truth, the truth of your word, the truth of who you are, the truth of what you came to do and accomplish and how, yeah, by us believing in you we receive you and so much more.

So we thank you Father, it's in your name, amen.

Excuse me.

So we start the text, of course, at the very beginning of chapter, verse 52 here, the Jews then to be disputed among themselves saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

And of course that's in response to the earlier, we're kind of right in the middle of Jesus and the Jews going back and forth here in Capernaum and the people are confused, right?

They ask, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

And Jesus then doubles down.

In earlier verses, he just brought up his flesh and now Jesus goes, Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life.

But it's not just eternal life, right?

Of course we get eternal life raised up on the last day.

Then later in verse 56 he says, Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I in him.

That's crazy.

Whoever feeds on my flesh drinks my blood.

Of course feeding on flesh and drinking his blood is not literally going to Jesus and eating his flesh and drinking his blood.

This is a metaphor just like John chapter 3, metaphor of you must be born again, you must eat and drink his flesh, which we've discovered throughout this text that eating his flesh and drinking his blood is believing in him.

It is belief and in fact we get it here in this text.

It says that it is believing, is what the eating is, is what the drinking is, it is eating.

And so when we feed on Jesus' flesh and drink of his blood, when we believe that he is the Son of God, if we believe that he is the lamb of God who is worthy, who is worthy to be praised, if we believe that Jesus is who he says he is, the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, my brain is operating on halftime if you couldn't tell, we get this eternal life but then he says drinks my blood abides in me and I in him, which if you're familiar with John at all, hearing that word abide should immediately take you to John chapter 15 where Jesus says, I think it's 15 or 16 times he uses the word abide or remain depending on the translation you're looking at but that's exactly what it means to abide is to remain and Jesus says here in verse 56, whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me remains in me and I in him.

So we get not just eternal life but an eternal resting of Jesus, of course the spirit.

I just love that.

So Jesus is giving these Jews in Capernaum this hard and yet truthful saying and their response is exactly that.

This is a hard saying, who can listen to it?

And of course they're not just saying like listen to it like you might listen to a podcast.

This is listening and hearing meant doing.

So who can do this?

This is a hard saying, who can do this?

And then Jesus knowing in himself, verse 61, that is disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, do you take offense at this?

Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?

Essentially going this is just the tip of the iceberg of what I have come to do and of course it's a hard saying because the Jews had an idea they had a construct or a concept of what the Messiah was supposed to do and Jesus wasn't filling in their shoes.

He was fulfilling prophecy.

He was fulfilling Old Testament prophecy.

He was doing what he came to do, what the Father sent him to do, not what the Jews desired him to do.

And Jesus is saying, essentially saying you have to give up your entire idea of the Messiah and trust in me.

You have to drop all of your preconceived notions of who a savior is supposed to be, who your Savior is supposed to be, and trust in me.

Not completely of course because some of it is obviously it's right there in the text.

But you have to trust in me.

Jesus is saying partake completely of me and what you get is eternal life and not only eternal life but I will abide in you.

I will remain in you.

That's beautiful, crazy.

Then Jesus tells us not all will accept it and not all are granted to Jesus by the Father.

That's our verse 65.

And what's the response?

The people, many of the disciples turned back and no longer walked with him.

They said this is a hard saying, I can't do it.

I'm gonna I'm gonna walk away.

And I believe what Jesus is asking of us in this text as we read it thousands of years later is do you want to go away as well?

Do you want to take up your cross and follow me is what Jesus is saying.

Do you want to take up your cross and follow Jesus?

And I love the response of Peter here who goes, Lord whom shall we go?

What else am I gonna do in this world?

What what else can I do but follow you?

Peter says you have the words of eternal life and we believe and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.

I can say that to be true of my life.

I have seen Jesus at work.

I have heard the words of eternal life.

Not only have I heard them but I believe them and I have come to know that Jesus is the Holy One of God.

That's that's it right there.

Like we can be at home sick.

You can be out and about enjoying the New Year.

We can be doing all these things but when we see the hard truth and hard teachings of Jesus are you going to go away or submit to the truth, know the truth, hear the words of eternal life, believe in him, and come to know that you are the that he is the Holy One.

I've seen it in my life that he is the Holy One, that he is worthy to be praised, that he turns any situation and circumstance for good.

Sometimes even when it doesn't seem like it, he does.

And not that, not that he has to, but he is just so sovereign and so holy that he can do exactly what he wants to do.

I'm rambling here.

Wrestle with the hard truths of Jesus.

He is the Messiah.

We must feed on his flesh and drink his blood.

We must believe that he was who he said he was, is who he says he is, and then we will come to see that he is the Holy One of God.

My prayer for our church this year, my prayer for us right now in this moment is that we would come to see the Holy One of God.

And of course we can turn in our scriptures and the first guy that I came to think of and obviously I'm not praying this for you, but if this is your 2025, then so be it.

We'll be there with you all the way, but I think of Job and Job of course goes through hell on earth, then all the bad things happen to him.

And the end of Job has this conversation where God is essentially saying to Job like, were you there when I set the earth in motion?

Were you there when I told the waters to stop and the land to start?

Were you there?

All these things.

And Job came to know the Holy One of God through the terror that happened in his life.

And whether it is terror or is triumph for you, whether it's health or sickness for you, I pray that you would come to know, have a deeper knowing of the Holy One of God.

Yeah, that's all I got.

Love you guys.
