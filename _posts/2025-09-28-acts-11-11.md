description: "How Christ's ascension and the Spirit's power shape our mission today.

In this sermon, we'll explore:

- The command to wait and the promise to go — Jesus tells His disciples to remain in Jerusalem until they receive the Spirit, reminding us that God's mission is always fueled by His power, not ours.

- The witness of the Church — Acts 1:8 sets the trajectory for the whole book of Acts: Spirit-filled disciples becoming bold witnesses, carrying the gospel from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth.

- The significance of the ascension of Jesus — Christ's return to the Father secures His intercession as our High Priest, sends the Spirit to dwell in us, and assures us of His return."

## Transcription

How many times do you need to be told something for you to, like, actually do it?

Or maybe remember how to do it?

Or maybe a better question is, how many times does it take your children to do something when you ask them to do it?

Probably more than we'd like to admit, and in this text we will see how Jesus actually tells His disciples something they've heard time and time again, and how they needed remembering and how often we need remembering of what Jesus has told us.

And so let me welcome us to the book of Acts.

This is week one of a study which I don't get to say often, and so I'm going to say welcome to week one.

We've spent the last 54 weeks in the book of John looking at it verse by verse, and that was 54 weeks of looking at all, as it says here in Acts 2, verse 1, looking at all Jesus began to do and teach, we've just spent the last 54 weeks doing that, and so we turn the page to the book of Acts, and I am so excited to look at this book.

And we see right here at the very jump, in this first book, in this first book, in this first book, O Theophilus, what book is that?

That is the book of Luke.

So Luke is the author of, oh, what beautiful handwriting.

Luke is the author of both Luke and Acts, and so back, in back days, it would be very, the text, these writings were written down on scrolls, and the scrolls were limited to certain size and length, because you didn't want to carry around a huge scroll that contained all of everything, and so Luke took two volumes, and in his first volume, he dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach.

And so that's what we find in the book of Luke, and which I guess leads us to the question of who was Luke?

Oh, I forgot I had these on the same one, and now I've got a mess.

Now I've got a mess.

Let me get this out of here.

There we go.

So the author of Acts is Luke, and what do we know about Luke?

So Luke was a physician.

It tells us that in Colossians.

Paul writes and says that Luke was a physician, and he's also a companion and traveler with Paul. 2 Timothy tells us Luke alone is with me, and also we will see in the back half of the book of Acts, which we see some of the pronouns and pronouns used, turn to we, because Luke is documenting where Paul is going, has different missionary journeys, and Luke was a companion of Paul, and so he says, we went and did this.

We went and did that.

We went here, and we went there, and so he's writing from that perspective.

And then the question is, what about Theophilus?

Oh, whoops.

What about Theophilus?

So Theophilus there, he could have been just a Christian wanting instruction.

His name in and of itself means friend of God or lover of God.

It's a combination of two Greek words of theos or theos, which means God, and then philia, which means love, which is one of the four Greek words of love.

And that word specifically is often described as brotherly love, so like Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.

And so it could be just another Christian that he's writing to, or if we were to look at his first book, Theophilus is described as most excellent, most excellent, which that phrasing is usually reserved to address people who held high office.

So Theophilus, which I think is Theophilus' name in the Bible, could have been some sort of official in the Roman government.

And what did Luke want Theophilus to know?

He wanted him to know verse 8.

Oh man, I really just, I'm all over the place here.

What's, this is the theme verse of all of Acts.

But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.

Luke is recording the works of the apostles, again, mainly Peter and Paul.

And he is recording how the gospel will spread through Jerusalem, then Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth, which the ends of the earth for them look like the Roman world, but that's for a later time.

And so this is not a full history of the early church.

In fact, it covers about 30 years of the early church.

And when Acts is usually taught and preached in churches today, how it is usually covered is in two ways.

Is, is Acts descriptive or is it prescriptive?

Is it descriptive?

Is it describing what happened?

Or is it prescriptive?

It's like a prescription telling you what to do.

Is Acts descriptive or prescriptive?

And so just right from the jump, let me tell you, I think it's both.

I think it's both.

I think there are some times where it is describing what happened.

And then there are other times where it's a prescription, a, for us Christians to take.

It is prescribing what us Christians should do.

It is telling us what to do.

For example, uh, we did not see Jesus ascend into heaven, right?

We should not see Jesus descend into heaven here and now, but the apostles did the disciples did there.

And what, what did they do?

They went and stared up into the sun.

They watched him float away.

Like we've probably, or our children have watched a floating balloon, just kind of go up, up, up, up, up.

And we should not after service go outside, look up and just wait for Jesus to come.

One, we'll probably be there for a long time.

Two, your neck is going to hurt.

Your back's going to hurt.

And also you're not going to have angels come and look at you.

You're going to have people drive by you and look at you strange, but they won't be no angels.

And so that is not a prescription of what we should do.

But the main verse being his witnesses.

Oh yeah, for sure.

That's a prescription.

And I think maybe too often us as believers, we leave that prescription on the counter.

Okay, let's get back to the text before I get my application five minutes in.

Acts 1.1.

In the first book, O Theophilus, I've dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day when he was taken up.

After he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen, he presented himself alive to them after his sufferings by many proofs, appearing to them during 40 days and speaking about the kingdom of God.

Luke is saying here, hey Theophilus, remember in my first book?

He's just catching him up.

He's like, hey, you remember in my first book how I told you about how Jesus died?

And then on the third day he rose again.

And well, after that, he hung around with his disciples for about 40 days.

And Paul will later tell us in 1 Corinthians that he appeared to 500 people in those 40 days.

And of course, in the context of when this was written, there would still be people alive who would have seen Jesus afterwards.

And so eyewitness account, eyewitness testimony, of course, it's so important.

And then Luke, he goes, in fact, I'm going to tell you one of these stories of what happened in these 40 days.

And it actually happens to be the last of the 40 days, if you were counting, when while staying with them, Jesus, he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which he said, you heard from me, for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit, not many days from now.

So Luke is reminding Theophilus and giving him context and then says, hey, this is actually one of the last things Jesus said to the apostles, to his disciples.

He told them to wait.

You heard from me.

Verse 5, for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit, not many days from now.

So the instructions of Jesus are to wait and wait for the promised Holy Spirit.

And as they needed reminding, and as we need reminding, Jesus already told them these things in the upper room.

Let's go back to John chapter 14.

These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you, but the helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to you, bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.

Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you.

Not as the world gives do I give to you.

Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.

You heard me say to you, I am going away and I will come to you.

If you loved me, you would have rejoiced because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.

And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place, you may believe.

Jesus already told them these things, and here he is reminding them of what is to come.

Remember in the upper room, remember when I told you I was going to the Father, and once I go, I will send the Spirit, and will come, and he'll be with you forever?

Remember that I said those things?

And the disciples are like, yeah, yeah, that's super cool, Jesus, but like, when are you going to restore the kingdom of Israel?

I don't know if you've ever been in a conversation, and you're like trying to explain something to them, and then they ask a question that has nothing to do, what you were just talking about?

They're still stuck.

They still don't get it.

They still don't understand the kingdom that Christ was bringing, and then he brought to, of course, the Jews, but not only the Jews, the Gentiles.

They still don't get it.

The disciples are still like, okay, yeah, but like, come on, like, are we building an army?

Like, you appear to these 500?

Like, come on, let's go, Jesus.

Let's go.

We've taken over.

Let's go.

And Jesus, in all of his patience, says, it is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.

That's not for you to know.

Jesus is essentially saying, I've established my kingdom on earth, and now it's time for you to go cultivate it.

It's time for you to bring that kingdom to fruition.

Jesus is essentially saying here, that great commission, that command that I have given you time and time again, I want you to actually do it.

This is how my kingdom will advance upon the earth, is you, through my witnesses, empowered through the Spirit, not through force, not through government, not through crazy marketing campaigns, but Holy Spirit-powered people witnessing of my name and my works.

Have you ever had a chance to witness to a non-believer before or to lead someone to Christ?

Have you ever had a chance to do that?

In my years of ministry, I've had plenty of chances to do that, but truth be told, it's been a while for me that I've sat down with a non-believer and explained to them faith in Jesus Christ and all of the good news and the gospel.

Just the other day, I was at a coffee shop, a very interesting coffee shop, I won't tell you the name yet.

But I was there, and I was sitting down, and I was talking with the owner of the coffee shop and then one of his regulars.

We were sitting down, and of course, they asked me what I do.

And, oh, I'm a pastor.

Oh, really?

Okay.

It's like, immediately after, it's like, they're like, okay, well, what have I said?

Did I say anything?

Like, do I have to apologize for any curses?

Like, you know, this, that, and the other, and then one of the regulars at the coffee shop was like, oh, yeah, that's super cool.

Like, I'm an atheist, yada, yada, yada, and I didn't press into the rest of the conversation.

And it didn't feel like the time was right, but I had a question teed up, and then, of course, he left.

But I bring that up because maybe there's some of you in this room, and you're like, man, I actually do desire to lead someone to the Lord.

I would love for an opportunity to do that.

And if you are that person, when we all rev up, would you just come and tell me that?

One, so I can pray for you, but also I can check in and hold you accountable, and that you would begin to pray that the Lord would give you people in your life.

And maybe it's even one of your children that you would continue to pour into them and continue to be a witness to them.

Maybe it's a co-worker or a friend, but I pray that the Lord would lead all of us to be people who desire such a thing, even if it's outside of your comfort zone, even if it seems crazy.

But if you are a believer, if you say, yeah, I'm a Christian, I believe in Jesus Christ, then this is what the Lord has asked them to do, but also us to do, that we would be His witnesses.

Verse 9, Man, what a scene.

Right?

Like, Jesus gives you this final command.

Jesus' last words.

This is the pump-up speech before the game, the halftime speech before you go out for the second half, like two-minute drill, last-minute drive, fourth quarter, like, come on, we've got to go put some points on the board.

You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop Y'all know what I'm talking about.

And this guy, he was like, like Jesus, like I had a vision and he's African.

And so he said, I had the vision from God.

September 23rd, September 24th, Jesus is going to return.

Of course he was wrong because we're here.

It's the 28th.

He was off by a couple of days.

Jesus still ain't back yet.

And what did Jesus tell his disciples then?

And what is he reminding us of now that it's not for us to know.

It's not for us to know when Jesus will return.

But until that time, he's given us a job to do.

Something that is vitally important to our faith and belief in Jesus Christ is not only his death, burial, and resurrection, but also his ascension.

And that's what we see here at the end of this verses here is Jesus ascending to heaven.

And so I want to ask, why is the ascension important?

Why is Jesus ascending important?

I'm so glad you asked.

The ascension is important because it completes his resurrection.

The ascension completes his resurrection.

Romans 8, 34.

Christ Jesus is the one who died.

More than that, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.

So Jesus was raised from the dead and also raised to be seated at the right hand of the Father.

The ascension completes his resurrection.

Also, without the ascension, we are without a high priest.

If Christ is not seated at the right hand of the Father, who is our high priest?

How can we be confident of our salvation from the wrath of God?

Hebrews 7, 24.

But he holds his priesthood permanently.

Permanently he holds his priesthood.

Because he continues forever.

Why?

Because he ascended.

Verse 25.

Consequently, he is able to save us to the uttermost, those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.

That is very good news.

Because of Jesus interceding for us, and his perfect life being the substitution for our imperfect life, we can be saved.

Hebrews will also tell us that we can approach the throne with confidence because of this high priest.

And if Christ does not ascend, we do not have our high priest.

And lastly, if Christ does not ascend, the Holy Spirit does not come.

John 16, 17.

For if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you.

But if I go, I will send him to you.

If Christ does not ascend, the Spirit does not come.

Jesus came and accomplished all that he could accomplish and all that he was supposed to accomplish so that we could be powered and filled with the Spirit.

And I'm so excited that we're going to be spending the next however many weeks through this book of Acts so we can actually see what the Scripture says about being filled with the Spirit.

But as we close this morning, I want to encourage you, challenge you, and remind you of your mission.

Jesus saying you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth was not descriptive but prescriptive.

And so if you are a Christian, you are called to go.

Go where?

Go where God has placed you.

To be a witness.

So the question I have for you is what do the people around you witness?

What do the people around you witness?

It could be a spouse if you're married.

It could be your children.

It could be co-workers, friends, family, siblings.

What do the people around you witness?

What do they witness about you?

Paul will tell us in Galatians, I have been crucified with Christ.

It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.

In the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me.

Do the people around you witness Christ in you?

Do they see Christ in you?

And this is not behavior modification.

Sure, it will get there, but we do not start there.

Because if we start there, then we live, as Paul says, now I live in the flesh.

If we start with behavior modification, then we do not live by faith, we live by works.

If we start with behavior modification, we end up disappointed.

And we end up weighed down by the law.

We end up weighed down by not being good enough.

We end up being weighed down by our imperfection.

No, first we must look to our Savior.

First we must look to Christ by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me.

And as I look at Christ and I look at how He loved me, then my works may change.

We must look to our Savior and ask for His Spirit to challenge us and to change us because we cannot do it on our own.

And so as I ask the question, what do people around you witness? you might start thinking, man, well, I have this and that and the next.

And so we do not go straight to changing that behavior.

We go straight to the Father and say, Lord, I see this in me.

By faith, I submit it to You.

By faith, I come to You asking that You would transform me from the inside out that I would have a greater understanding, a greater idea of what it means to submit to You, a greater understanding and meaning of what it looks to abide and remain in You, Lord Jesus.

And from that, may the fruit of the Spirit begin to show in You.

May the fruit of the Spirit begin to be what people see about You.

Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.

You cannot do it on your own.

So do not try to do it on your own, but go to the Father.

Would you pray with me?

Spirit, may You work in us that we might be Your witnesses to the people around us.

Spirit, that You would begin to speak to us.

Show us, Lord, how we have fallen short.

Reveal to us the spaces and the places where we do not align with Your law and immediately help us go to Your Gospel, Your good news of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who was our perfect sacrifice.

And through the sending of Your Spirit, may we be transformed from the inside out.

We thank You, Jesus, for all that You have done.

Spirit, enable us to be Your witnesses this week.

Starting with the people in our homes and outward.

It's in Jesus' name we pray.
