## Transcription

But last week we answered the question, what do you do when you can't hear the voice of God?

And we kind of gave some things that we can do when we don't hear the voice of God.

And this question, this morning, the question we're going to ask is, what do you do when you don't know what to do?

What do you do when you don't know what to do?

Right?

Like if we look at this chapter for Peter, it was quite an easy answer.

He did what he did before his three years with Jesus.

He went back fishing.

That's what he did as his vocation.

He was a fisherman.

And so the beginning of John chapter 21 is telling us how Peter went back fishing.

And he took some of the disciples with him and they find Jesus on, well, Jesus finds them on that road and that journey.

And it was an unsuccessful evening, turned into a very memorable morning with Jesus, right?

And so Peter went back to doing what he always did.

And I think we can find ourselves sometimes in that.

It's almost like Ricky Bobby is when he drives the car for the first time.

He's like, I don't know what to do with my hands kind of moment.

And that's, I think, sometimes where we find ourselves is like in this, like, I don't know what to do.

And Jesus is going to push back on that for Peter.

And I believe the same for us.

So John 21 verse 15 says, and when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?

Does Simon love what more than these?

Does he love Jesus more than his friends, the other disciples?

Is that what Jesus is asking?

Right?

Yes.

Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?

Does he love his friends more than Jesus?

Does he love Jesus more than fishing, right?

His job, his vocation?

Or does he love Jesus more than the other disciples love Jesus?

Which one is it?

We don't know which one, but I'll take a stab at it.

Okay.

I think Jesus is asking, do you love me more than these other disciples love me?

And let me tell you why.

Well, Jesus in Luke 7 says, but he who is forgiven little loves little.

He who is forgiven little loves little.

And the opposite is also true.

He who is forgiven much loves much.

And Peter failed Jesus much.

He denied Jesus three times.

He knew he messed up.

He knew he failed Jesus.

And Jesus is asking him, do you love me more than these other disciples love me?

That's my guess.

But my question for you is, can you see how much you failed?

Can you see how you have broken God's good and perfect law?

Do you see?

Don't take this personally.

But do you see that you are a mess?

Do you see that you have failed the Lord miserably?

Which guess what?

We all have.

So I hope we can see that.

Because if you don't see that, you're fooling yourselves as that's what John will say in 1 John 1.

If you do not know that you've sinned, then you are fooling yourself and you make yourself out to be a liar.

That's what it says in 1 John.

And see, I believe if you do understand how much you've failed, how much of a sinner you are, then you have a greater response to the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ.

I believe this is what Jesus is getting out with Peter.

And in response, Peter says, yes, Lord, you know that I love you.

He said to him, feed my lambs.

He said to him a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me?

He said to him, yes, Lord, you know that I love you.

He said to him, tend my sheep.

He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love me?

Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, do you love me?

And he said to him, Lord, you know everything.

You know that I love you.

And Jesus said to him, feed my sheep.

So Jesus, in response to Peter saying that he does love him, Jesus tells him, feed my sheep.

And of course, in total, the text tells us that Jesus asked Peter three times.

Why three times?

Well, probably because that's how many times Peter denied Jesus before his crucifixion.

But also what Jesus is doing here is Jesus is reaffirming to Peter what Jesus told Peter he was going to do.

He said, Jesus said to Peter on this rock, I will build my church.

That's what Jesus said to Peter.

And now here is Jesus telling Peter that again, feed my sheep, feed my lambs, tend my sheep.

And how is that church being built?

Right.

Jesus says on this rock, I will build my church.

And how is that rock being built?

Well, it's by Peter feeding Jesus his sheep.

How does Peter do that?

Well, we'll come to learn and ask that he does that by preaching and also praying, which is why that's kind of the role of a pastor is to feed the sheep.

And why do the sheep need feeding?

Well, the way that a pastor feeds the sheep is by the declaration of the gospel.

And so that's how we are fed.

That's what we all need.

That's what sheep need.

Sheep need to hear the good news.

Sheep need the gospel.

How else do we know that we are sinners if not that we have the gospel?

How else do we, how else can the spirit turn our heart of stone into a heart of flesh by the declaration of the gospel?

How do we know we need a savior, the gospel?

How do we know we need salvation, the gospel?

And so Jesus is telling Peter, feed my sheep, tell them of me.

You get this interesting sort of declaration here in the midst of this response, right?

Like Jesus differentiates between lambs and sheep, which some like to say that feeding lambs or the lambs are the new believers, right?

Because a lamb is a baby sheep.

And then the sheep are the seasoned saints, if you will.

But regardless of the label, the mission of Peter then, and the mission for a pastor now is to feed the sheep, the gospel.

Why?

Because there is no other message that saves and no other message that is worthy of gathering on a weakly basis.

The gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ is our only hope in life and death.

The text continues, verse 18.

Saying truly, truly I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted.

But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.

This he said to show by what kind of death he was going to glorify God.

And after saying this, Jesus said to him, follow me.

So Peter gives, or Jesus gives Peter this thing on how he is going to die.

Which I don't know if growing up or maybe sometimes now you wonder, man, I wonder how I am going to go out.

But could you imagine, Peter, he might be still a teenager at this point, young 20s.

Well, he would live another 30 or so years and he had this hanging over his head every day that he declared the gospel.

Every day that he went out doing the mission of God, he knew this was going to come to pass.

It's kind of an interesting thought there.

What does Jesus say there at the end?

He says, follow me.

And it seems to me that Jesus is actually, by what we read after the text, it seems to me that Jesus is actually telling Peter, hey, follow me.

Like, hey, we are going this direction.

He's going to get up and he's like, maybe they're like having this talk around the fire.

And he's like, hey, man, come with me.

And so then he actually follows him.

But I think it goes both ways, like literally and figuratively, of Peter following Jesus.

But also these words would echo back to John 1 when Peter was first called by Jesus.

You know what those words were?

Follow me.

So a little double entendre there.

Verse 20, excuse me, Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had leaned back against him during the supper.

And had said, Lord, who is that?

Who is that is going to betray you?

So again, that first sentence there, Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them.

And he like kind of gets up and follows along with them.

And so whichever direction they're going, John, first off, he uses way too many words to describe himself.

Like you could just say like, yeah.

And so I got up and went, but he says, no, the one who had also leaned back against him during the supper and had said, Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?

It's like, just say your name, man, whatever.

Verse 21, when Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man?

Jesus said to him, if it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?

You follow me.

You and I, we do this all the time.

We look at sometimes the people around us.

We look at sometimes influencers and people online and go, Hey, what about this guy?

What about this chick?

And Jesus says to Peter, what is that to you?

Who cares what they're doing?

Who cares what these people are doing?

You follow me.

Verse 23.

So the saying spread among abroad, among the brothers that this disciple was not to die.

Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die.

But if it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?

Here are the words of Jesus getting twisted around.

That is not a new thing for our time.

We see from the very beginning of Jesus, I mean, even the very beginning of creation, the words of the Lord getting twisted around, which is why it's so important that we actually know the words of our Lord.

John is clarifying.

He says he did not say that John was not to die.

But if it was his will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?

This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things and who has written these things.

And we know that his testimony is true.

Now there are also many other things that Jesus did, where every one of them to be written.

I suppose that the world itself cannot contain the books that would be written.

John is saying here, I witnessed these things and I wrote about it.

I saw it and I wrote it.

And it's true.

And yeah, this isn't an exhaustive list of all the things that we saw and all the things that Jesus did.

If I were to do that, the world could not contain the books that would be written.

You see the fingerprints of God are on everything.

The good things we see and the horrendous things that God allows.

Even when we do not understand, God is working it for good.

The good things we see and the bad things we see.

I know there's many of us who are still wrestling with the tragedies of the last few weeks, with the stabbing of that young lady on that train with school shootings, multiple happening, with even more shootings and public shootings happening at new stations and places around our country this week.

And of course, the killing of Charlie Kirk.

Like, could God really use that for good?

I just want to take one moment here and talk about Charlie, because this is kind of a good example.

Regardless of your political affiliation or commitment, whatever, I don't care about that.

This man was a Christian.

He publicly declared his faith quite often.

And he loved the Lord.

What's also crazy is both him and I were born in the same year.

So it's kind of shocking to think about that, about leaving a young family behind.

But that's the reality of the situation and it's terrible.

But what we do not know is what God is going to do with the fruit of his life.

So I think we have to take political opinions aside.

Again, Charlie was not quiet about his faith in Jesus and as clips of Charlie continue to circulate the Internet, and they will for a long time, there will be people.

And now there have been people who will hear the Gospel because of his life.

I mean, last week I heard and I saw of churches being packed with people because of the tragedy.

I was very specific of a pastor saying I had multiple people come up to me saying this is my first time back in church for 5, 10, 15 years.

And the reason I came was because of Charlie.

And then these people talking to the pastor going, but I'm coming back next week for the Lord.

That's what God can do in the midst of tragedy.

That's what God can do when people hear the hope of Jesus Christ.

Why?

Because hope is found in church.

I'm not talking about a building.

I'm talking about the people of God.

And when we gather and declare that Jesus is Lord, there is hope.

There is peace.

There is freedom.

And there is hope.

What do you do when you don't know what to do?

What do you do when you don't know what to do?

Our natural response is to do what you've always done.

For Peter, again, he went back fishing.

But for you and for I, we do what we've always done.

I just got to go do what I need to do.

I got to take care of the kids.

I got to do that.

You can't do what God has called you to do.

When you are like Peter, yeah, well, what about John?

You cannot do what God has specifically called you to do.

Speaking of specifically, let's get some more specific.

Start with the husbands.

You must lead your home.

That is what God has called you to do.

Ephesians 5.

Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word so that he might present the church to himself in splendor without spot or wrinkle or any such thing that she might be holy and without blemish.

In the same way, husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.

He who loves his wife loves himself for no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it just as Christ does the church.

So this leading your homes is not just a providential leadership.

Leading your homes is not just providing a home, providing food and the essentials.

It's more than that.

It's emotional.

It's spiritual.

Men, if you are married, God has called you to your wife and this is how you should do it.

Do not neglect your marriage but nourish and cherish your bride.

Men, that's what you have been called to do if you are married.

And ladies, if you are married, do not hold this over your husband like the moment you get in the car.

You go, well that was a good message.

I especially love that verse on Ephesians.

What about you, hun?

No.

Do not hold this over your husband.

Instead, would you encourage him?

Would you encourage him to be the man that God has called him to be?

Would you tell him where he's doing well?

This goes for both the husband and the wife.

Your spouse is going to do something that you don't like.

There might be a consistent thing that you don't like.

It might be something random out of the blue and I would ask for all of us in here, when that thing happens, have you prayed before you confronted?

Have you prayed for your spouse before you've confronted your spouse?

A majority of the room here are married with young children and so we must make disciples of our children.

This is one of the most important callings God has called us to.

If that is not a focus and a priority in your home is discipling your children, then you are missing it.

What's a way to easily do that daily?

Family church.

Excuse me.

Spending time in the word with your child, again in an age appropriate manner and going over the catechism, that's why we do these things every week is so that we could very easily add these things within our week.

Maybe you have older children.

Do not stop praying for them.

What about our jobs?

Talk about marriage, kids, what about job?

Whatever your job is, outside of the house, work from home, maybe a homemaker, whatever your job is, God has called you to do excellent work at that job.

Why?

Because you are not working for yourself.

Colossians 3, 23 tells us, whatever you do, work heartily as for the Lord and not for men.

Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward.

You are serving the Lord Christ.

It is so popular in our world and in our culture to think that we work for retirement, to think that we work until a certain age and then finally we can stop.

Well, as Christians we have a different idea of work.

Why?

Because work, Adam and Eve worked before the fall.

Work is from God.

Work is good.

And here Paul is saying to the church in Colossia, whatever you do, work heartily as for the Lord and not for men.

Your job, whether it be at home, working from home, a homemaker, out in the marketplace, whatever you do, you are not working for a boss here on earth.

You are not your own boss.

The Lord is your boss and you are working for him.

You are serving the Lord Christ.

You are not working for yourself.

You are not working for a paycheck.

You are not working just to put food on the table.

Sure, there are those things that are involved in it.

But whatever you do, work heartily as for the Lord and not for men.

Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward.

You are serving the Lord Christ.

God has called us to follow him.

That calling, that commission is enough because it is all encompassing.

So what has God called you to?

God has called you to follow him.

And that's enough.

Because following him is in every part of our lives.

Remember we have renewed minds in Christ Jesus.

So maybe where in your life is that calling not quite being achieved?

And would you begin by praying for the grace and mercy to see how to do that?

We are not going to will power our way there.

The Lord has empowered us by his spirit to do these things.

We cannot do them on our own.

So leaving this moment going like, yeah, I can do this.

Yeah, you can, but not from your own power, not from your own will.

Because then that becomes a burden on you.

You know God has given us these things, these people in our lives, our jobs to be a blessing.

Sometimes there will be burden.

But as we submit these things back to the Lord continually, he will do the work that we cannot do.

And he will begin to change us.

And we'll see how we can more truly follow him.

Not looking to the right or to the left.

Wondering what they're doing, wondering what he's doing.

Sure we can learn from each other.

But the Lord has given you the people in your life.

The Lord has given you children in your life.

The job.

To show and to lead and to be Jesus' hands and feet wherever God has already placed you.

Would you pray with me?

Jesus we thank you.

We thank you for this letter, this gospel message that John wrote.

It is incredible.

We thank you for the time that we got to gather as a church to learn and to grow.

Lord I pray that as we learn more fully what it looks like to follow you, that we would see it doesn't have to be extra complicated, that we could see in our everyday ordinary life, that you've put us in.

You're asking us to see that as our calling.

To see our marriage as special and important.

To see our children as special and important for the sake of your name and your gospel.

To see our jobs and vocations as special and important.

Why?

Because you've given them to us as a way to serve you and serve the people around us.

Lord would you convict our hearts and show us how we can be better examples of what it looks like to follow you.

Thank you Lord for this morning.

In Jesus name I pray.

Amen.
