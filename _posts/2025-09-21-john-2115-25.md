description: "Comparison kills calling—and Christ simply calls us to follow Him.

In this sermon, we'll explore John 21:15–25, where the risen Jesus restores Peter with three questions of love, commissions him to feed the sheep, and calls him once again to follow. We'll see how Peter's tendency to compare himself to John mirrors our own struggles with distraction, and how Jesus' words redirect us to faithfulness in our own lane.

- We'll reflect on how Jesus restores failures, transforming our denials into renewed callings.
- We'll consider why feeding God's people with the gospel is central to discipleship and ministry today.
- Finally, we'll hear Christ's challenge to stop looking sideways at others and instead follow Him with trust, courage, and obedience."

## Transcription

Last week, we answered the question, what do you do when you can't hear the voice of God?

And we kind of gave some things that we can do when we don't hear the voice of God, and this morning, the question we're going to ask is, what do you do when you don't know what to do?

What do you do when you don't know what to do?

Right?

Like, if we look at this chapter for Peter, it was quite an easy answer.

That's what he did as his vocation.

He was a fisherman, and so the beginning of John chapter 21 is telling us how Peter went back fishing, and he took some of the disciples with him, and they find Jesus on...

Well, Jesus finds them on that road and that journey, and it was an unsuccessful evening turned into a very memorable morning with Jesus, right?

And so Peter went back to doing what he always did.

And I think we can find ourselves sometimes in that.

It's almost like Ricky Bobby, when he drives the car for the first time, he's like, I don't know what to do with my hands kind of moment.

And that's, I think, sometimes where we find ourselves is like in this, like, I don't know what to do, and Jesus is going to push back on that for Peter, and I believe the same for us.

So John 21 verse 15 says, and when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?

Does Simon love what more than these?

Does he love Jesus more than his friends, the other disciples?

Is that what Jesus is asking?

Right?

Yes.

Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?

Does he love his friends more than Jesus?

Does he love Jesus more than fishing?

Right?

His job, his vocation?

Or does he love Jesus more than the other disciples love Jesus?

Which one is it?

We don't know which one, but I'll take a stab at it, okay?

I think Jesus is asking, do you love me more than these other disciples love me?

And let me tell you why.

Well, Jesus in Luke 7 says, but he who is forgiven little loves little.

He who is forgiven little loves little.

And the opposite is also true.

He who is forgiven much loves much.

And Peter failed Jesus much.

He denied Jesus three times.

He denied Jesus three times.

He knew he messed up.

He knew he failed Jesus.

And Jesus is asking him, do you love me more than these other disciples love me?

That's my guess.

But my question for you is, can you see how much you failed?

Can you see how you have broken God's good and perfect law?

Do you see, don't take this personally, but do you see that you are a mess?

Do you see that you have failed the Lord miserably?

Which guess what?

We all have.

So I hope we can see that.

Because if you don't see that, you're fooling yourselves.

That's what John will say in 1 John 1.

If you do not know that you've sinned, then you are fooling yourself.

And you make yourself out to be a liar.

That's what it says in 1 John.

And see, I believe if you do understand how much you've failed, how much of a sinner you are, then you have a greater response to the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ.

I believe this is what Jesus is getting at with Peter.

And in response, Peter says, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.

He said to him, feed my lambs.

He said to him a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me?

He said to him, yes, Lord, you know that I love you.

He said to him, tend my sheep.

He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love me?

Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, do you love me?

And he said to him, Lord, you know everything.

You know that I love you.

And Jesus said to him, feed my sheep.

So Jesus, in response to Peter saying that he does love him, Jesus tells him, feed my sheep.

And of course, in total, the text tells us that Jesus asked Peter three times.

Why three times?

Well, probably because that's how many times Peter denied Jesus before his crucifixion.

But also what Jesus is doing here is Jesus is reaffirming to Peter what Jesus told Peter he was going to do.

He said, Jesus said to Peter, on this rock, I will build my church.

That's what Jesus said to Peter.

And now here is Jesus telling Peter that again, feed my sheep, feed my lambs, tend my sheep.

And how is that church being built, right?

Jesus says, on this rock, I will build my church.

And how is that rock being built?

Well, it's by Peter feeding Jesus' sheep.

How does Peter do that?

Well, we'll come to learn in Acts that he does that by preaching and also praying.

Which is why that's kind of the role of a pastor, is to feed the sheep.

And why do the sheep need feeding?

Well, the way that a pastor feeds the sheep is by the declaration of the gospel.

And so that's how we are fed.

That's what we all need.

That's what sheep need.

Sheep need to hear the good news.

Sheep need the gospel.

How else do we know that we are sinners if not that we have the gospel?

How else can the Spirit turn a heart of stone into a heart of flesh by the declaration of the gospel?

How do we know we need a Savior?

The gospel.

How do we know we need salvation?

The gospel.

And so Jesus is telling Peter, feed my sheep.

Tell them of me.

We get this interesting sort of declaration here in the midst of this response, right?

Like Jesus differentiates between lambs and sheep, which some like to say that feeding lambs or the lambs are the new believers, right?

Because a lamb is a baby sheep.

And then the sheep are the seasoned saints, if you will.

But regardless of the label, the mission of Peter then and the mission for a pastor now is to feed the sheep, the gospel.

Why?

Because there is no other message that saves and no other message that is worthy of gathering on a weekly basis.

The gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ, is our only hope in life and death.

The text continues.

Verse 18, Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted.

But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.

This he said to show by what kind of death he was going to glorify God.

And after saying this, Jesus said to him, Follow me.

And so Jesus gives Peter this thing on how he's going to die, which I don't know if growing up or even maybe sometimes now you wonder, like, man, I wonder how I'm going to go out.

But could you imagine Peter, he might be still a teenager at this point, young 20s.

Well, he would live another, like, 30 or so years, and he had this hanging over his head every day that he declared the gospel.

Every day that he went out doing the mission of God, he knew this was going to come to pass.

It's kind of an interesting thought there, but what does Jesus say there at the end?

He says, follow me.

And it seems to me that Jesus is actually, by what we read after the text, it seems to me that Jesus is actually telling Peter, like, hey, like, follow me.

Like, hey, we're going this direction.

Like, he's going to get up.

Maybe they're, like, having this talk around the fire, and he's like, hey, man, come with me.

And so then he actually follows him.

But I think it goes both ways, like, literally and figuratively, of Peter following Jesus.

But also these words would echo back to John 1 when Peter was first called by Jesus.

And you know what those words were?

Follow me.

So, yeah, a little double entendre there.

Verse 20.

Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had leaned back against him during the supper, and had said, Lord, who is that is going to betray you?

So, again, that first sentence there, Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, and he, like, kind of gets up and follows along with them.

And so whichever direction they're going, John, first off, he uses way too many words to describe himself.

Like, you could just say, like, yeah, and so I got up and went.

But he says, no, the one who had also leaned back against him during the supper, and had said, Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?

It's like, just say your name, man, whatever.

Verse 21.

When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man?

Jesus said to him, If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?

You follow me.

You and I, we do this all the time.

We look at sometimes the people around us.

We look at sometimes influencers and people online, and go, hey, what about this guy?

What about this chick?

And Jesus says to Peter, what is that to you?

Who cares what they're doing?

Who cares what these people are doing?

You follow me.

Verse 23.

So the saying spread abroad among the brothers, that this disciple was not to die.

Yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die.

But if it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?

Here are the words of Jesus getting twisted around.

That is not a new thing for our time.

We see from the very beginning of Jesus, I mean even the very beginning of creation, the words of the Lord getting twisted around.

Which is why it's so important that we actually know the words of our Lord.

John is clarifying.

He says, He did not say that John was not to die.

But if it was his will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?

This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things and who has written these things and we know that his testimony is true.

Now there are also many other things that Jesus did.

Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself cannot contain the books that would be written.

John is saying here, I witnessed these things and I wrote about it.

I saw it and I wrote it.

And it's true.

And yeah, this isn't an exhaustive list of all the things that we saw and all the things that Jesus did.

If I were to do that, the world could not contain the books that would be written.

You see, the fingerprints of God are on everything.

The good things we see and the horrendous things that God allows.

Even when we do not understand it, God is working it for good.

The good things we see and the bad things we see.

I know there's many of us who are still wrestling with the tragedies of the last few weeks, with the stabbing of that young lady on that train, with school shootings, multiple happening, with even more shootings and public shootings happening at new stations and places around our country this week.

And of course, the killing of Charlie Kirk.

Like, could God really use that for good?

I just want to take one moment here and talk about Charlie because this is kind of a good example.

Regardless of your political affiliation or commitment, whatever, I don't care about that.

This man was a Christian.

He publicly declared his faith quite often.

And he loved the Lord.

And what's also crazy is both him and I were born in the same year.

And so it's kind of shocking to think about that, about leaving a young family behind.

But that's the reality of the situation.

And it's terrible.

But what we do not know is what God is going to do with the fruit of his life.

Political opinions aside, again, Charlie was not quiet about his faith in Jesus.

And as clips of Charlie continue to circulate the internet, and they will for a long time, there will be people.

And now there have been people who will hear the gospel because of his life.

I mean, last week, I heard and I saw of churches being packed with people because of the tragedy.

I even heard a specific of a pastor saying, I had multiple people come up to me saying, this is my first time back in church for five, ten, fifteen years.

And the reason I came was because of Charlie.

And then these people talking to the pastor going, but I'm coming back next week for the Lord.

That's what God can do in the midst of tragedy.

That's what God can do when people hear the hope of Jesus Christ.

Why?

Because hope is found in church.

I'm not talking about a building.

I'm talking about the people of God.

And when we gather and declare that Jesus is Lord, there is hope.

There is peace.

There is freedom.

So, what do you do when you don't know what to do?

What do you do when you don't know what to do?

Our natural response is to do what you've always done.

For Peter, again, he went back fishing.

But for you and for I, we do what we've always done.

I just got to go do what I need to do.

I got to take care of the kids.

I got to do this.

I got to do that.

I got to go to work.

I got to eat.

I got to work out.

I got to do the whole laundry list of your life.

You're saying, I just, I don't know what to do.

I just, I just keep going.

I just keep doing.

But what does Jesus tell Peter to do instead?

He says, feed his sheep and follow him.

Feed his sheep and follow him.

And what is Peter's response?

Well, what about John?

Comparison kills calling.

Comparison kills calling.

Jesus just told Peter what to do.

And Peter is not focused on what the Lord told him to do.

He's focused on John.

He's focused on what's going on around him.

I went out to coffee the other day with a buddy and he was saying how people all around him, they have this like very like specific calling.

They have this very specific thing that they're like doing. and he was he was he was like they just have this very specific vision and direction and he just kind of feels like he doesn't and I asked him very plainly I said hey is the Great Commission not enough? is what God has called all of his followers to do is that not enough?

Like Jesus he specifically says in John chapter 20 21 as the Father has sent me even so I am sending you and so Jesus is our example because the Father sent Jesus and here he says even so I am sending you that's John's version of the Great Commission we can look to Matthew where it very very clearly gives us the Great Commission to go and make disciples of all nations teaching them to observe everything that I that I have commanded you is that not enough? we have been called to follow Jesus and that might look differently and it will look differently for all of us and thank God it does because if we were all to do the same thing and look exactly the same way we wouldn't do a very good job at reaching a lot of different people all looking the same and doing the same might be good on an assembly line but it does not look good with people and when you compare you can't do what God has called you to do when you are like Peter yeah well what about John? you cannot do what God has specifically called you to do speaking of specifically let's get some more specific start with the husbands you must lead your home that is what God has called you to do Ephesians 5 husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her that he might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word so that he might present the church to himself in splendor without spot or wrinkle or any such thing that she might be holy and without blemish in the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself for no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it just as Christ does the church so this leading your homes is not just a providential leadership leading your homes is not just providing a home providing food and the essentials it's more than that it's emotional it's spiritual men if you are married God has called you to your wife and this is how you should do it do not neglect your marriage but nourish and cherish your bride men that's what you have been called to do if you are married and ladies if you are married do not hold this over your husband like the moment you get in the car you go well that was a good message I especially love that verse on Ephesians what about you hun no do not hold this over your husband instead would you encourage him would you encourage him to be the man that God has called him to be would you tell him where he's doing well this goes for both the husband and the wife your spouse is going to do something that you don't like there might be a consistent thing that you don't like might be something random out of the blue and I would ask for all of us in here when that thing happens have you prayed before you confronted have you prayed for your spouse before you've confronted your spouse the majority of the room here are married with young children and so we must make disciples of our children this is one of the most important callings God has called us to and if that is not a focus and a priority in your home is discipling your children then you are missing it what's a way to easily do that daily family church excuse me spending time in the word with your child again in an age appropriate manner and going over the catechism that's why we do these things every week is so that we could very easily add these things within our week maybe you have older children do not stop praying for them maybe send scriptures to encourage them learn how to be present in their lives even if they are not under your roof okay what about what about our jobs talked about marriage talked about kids what about job whatever your job is outside of the house work from home maybe a homemaker whatever your job is God has called you to do excellent work at that job why because you are not working for yourself Colossians 3 23 tells us whatever you do work heartily as for the Lord and not for men knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward you are serving the Lord Christ it is so popular in our in our world and in our culture to think that we work for retirement to think that we work until a certain age and then finally we can stop well as Christians we have a different idea of work why because work Adam and Eve worked before the fall work is from God work is good and here Paul is saying to the church in Colossia whatever you do work heartily as for the Lord and not for men your job whether it be at home being a working from home a homemaker out in the marketplace whatever you do you are not working for a boss here on earth you are not your own boss the Lord is your boss and you are working for him you are serving the Lord Christ you are not working for yourself you are not working for a paycheck you are not working just to put food on the table sure there are those things that are involved in it but whatever you do work heartily as for the Lord and not for men knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward you are serving the Lord Christ God has called us to follow him that calling that commission is enough because it is all encompassing so what has God called you to God has called you to follow him and that's enough because following him is in every part of our lives remember we have renewed minds in Christ Jesus so maybe where in your life is that calling not quite being achieved and would you begin by praying for the grace and mercy to see how to do that we're not going to willpower our way there the Lord has empowered us by his spirit to do these things we cannot do them on our own and so leaving this moment going like yeah I can I can I can do this yeah you can but not from your own power not from your own will because that becomes a burden on you no God has given us these these things these people in our lives our jobs to be a blessing sometimes there will be burden but as we submit these things back to the Lord continually he will do the work that we cannot do and he will begin to change us and we'll see how we can more truly follow him not looking to the right or to the left wondering what they're doing wondering what he's doing sure we can learn from each other but the Lord has given you the people in your life the Lord has given you children in your life the job to show and to lead and to be Jesus' hands and feet wherever God has already placed you would you pray with me Jesus we thank you we thank you for this letter this gospel message that John wrote it is incredible we thank you for the time that we got to gather as a church to to learn and to grow Lord I pray that as we learn more fully what it looks like to follow you that we would see it doesn't have to be extra complicated that we could see in our everyday ordinary life that you've put us in you're asking us to to see that as our calling to see our marriage as special and important as special and important for the sake of your name and your gospel to see our jobs and vocations as special and important why because you've given them to us as a way to serve you and serve the people around us Lord would you convict our hearts and show us how we can be better examples of what it looks like to follow you thank you Lord for this morning it's in Jesus name I pray amen
