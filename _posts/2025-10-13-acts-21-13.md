## Transcription

Great.

So let me quickly give a recap.

Acts chapter 2 here.

At the very start, we see, of course, the Holy Spirit falls, then the disciples speak in different languages, and all these people are there like, yo, what does this mean?

And then Peter stands up and preaches.

They're cut to the heart.

What do we do?

And then Peter says, repent, be baptized, receive the Holy Spirit, and then 3,000 are added to that number daily.

Like I said, we're starting with just the first 13 verses, but I'm going to reference some of these other things.

That's why I wanted us to get all that in.

But before we begin, because this is a beautiful passage, and depending on how you grew up, depending on personal religious experience, you come to this passage with a certain mindset and a certain understanding.

And so before we do that, I just want to ask this question.

Should the Bible be understood in light of personal religious experience?

Or should personal religious experience be understood in light of the Bible?

That's a...

You don't have to answer the question.

Should the Bible be understood in light of personal religious experience?

Or should personal religious experience be understood in light of the Bible?

Because based on our experience, we can interpret and emphasize the scripture in one way or another.

So this morning, my goal is to understand this scene and to understand Acts chapter 2 in light of scripture, as well as looking at first century Judaism and begin with that context and interpret it that way.

So let me pray for us.

Lord, would you open our eyes to your word?

Let your word only be a lamp to our feet and light to our path.

Not your word plus our experiences and upbringing.

Lord, would you teach us and thank you, Holy Spirit, for bringing us to the knowledge of the Son and the work you did all these years ago.

Thank you for being present with us as well as your presence is in our midst this morning.

I pray these things in Jesus' name, everyone said.

Amen.

Amen.

When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place.

They were all together in one place.

So the first question we need to ask is, what is Pentecost?

What is Pentecost?

The day of Pentecost fell on the 50th day.

Oh no, what just happened?

No.

There we go.

The day of Pentecost fell on the 50th day after Passover.

So that's what we need to know.

And it's a festival.

It's also known as the Feast of Weeks, as well as the Day of Firstfruits.

Because on that day, the first fruits of wheat harvest.

So, and that first fruit of wheat was harvest.

It was presented to God.

And at a later date, after the temple was destroyed and then rebuilt, at a later date when the temple was rebuilt, it was believed to be the anniversary of the giving of the law on Mount Sinai.

This day of Pentecost had some pretty big sort of Old Testament understanding.

It was kind of a big deal.

And it had some significance to the Jewish calendar.

And in Exodus 23, it actually tells us that all of the males should appear before the Lord for a certain three festivals.

And one of the festivals that all the males of the Lord should be present in Jerusalem at the temple for is this festival of first fruits.

So that gives us some context to why there are so many people in town, why 3,000 were added to their number that day, and why the apostles were all together in one place.

And then suddenly, there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.

So the question we need to ask is where were they?

Where were they in the upper room that we get described to in the chapter previous where it filled the entire house?

How are 3,000 people going to fit in this room or in this place or in a street?

Like where are all these people?

Because at least, at minimum, 3,000 were there.

We know that because that's how many were saved.

So were there 6,000, 8,000?

We don't know the ratio of saved to unsaved.

The Bible doesn't give us that detail.

We just know that 3,000 were added to their number that day.

So that's the minimum number we can go off of. 1st century homes in Jerusalem were situated kind of in the midst of like narrow alleyways.

So this would not really allow for such a big crowd to form.

But we can learn from the Jewish historian Josephus that in the courtyard of the temple were these meeting rooms, these homes, these places.

And there were about 30 of them scattered all throughout the courtyard of the Jewish temple.

And they had sort of like doorways or entryways from one to another so people could kind of roam throughout.

And if we want to take this a level deeper, Josephus, in this book, the word he uses to describe these...

Excuse me.

The word he uses to describe these temple courtyard places is the Greek word oikos, which is the exact same word that Luke here uses to describe where they were, this meeting room, this place.

It's the same word.

So it could be the same place.

It could be one of these meeting rooms.

It could be a home.

We don't really know.

But we also get this detail in verse 15 that it was 9 in the morning.

So, probably all the men were gathering and started to gather at the temple.

And then suddenly, from heaven, came a sound and a mighty rushing wind.

To me, it makes sense that that's probably where they were, would be kind of in the temple or in one of these temple rooms and courtyards.

Because even the 120 of the disciples that were all together and meeting there, that'd kind of be hard to fit 120 people in a first century Jewish home.

I don't know.

I've never been in a first century Jewish home.

But I'm just, I'm just guessing.

What is this mighty rushing wind that filled the house?

What is this mighty rushing wind?

Was it an actual wind?

Well, if we look at scripture, we can see multiple times where the spirit is described as a mighty rushing wind.

The first scripture that comes to mind is John 3, 8.

The wind blows where it wishes and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.

So it is with everyone who is born of the spirit.

So Jesus himself says those who are born of the spirit is, he's equating, excuse me, this mighty rushing wind to the spirit.

Ezekiel 37, 9 through 14.

It's the valley of the dry bones, if you're familiar with that story.

And Ezekiel, by God's command, he's called to prophesy to the wind and call it to blow on these dead bodies in this valley, in this vision.

And it was the breath of God that breathed life into them and filled them with new life.

And then, of course, Luke 3, 16.

John the Baptist says, I will baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.

He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.

So the spirit is pictured and portrayed in scripture as this mighty rushing wind and as well as fire.

Acts 2, verse 3, and divided tongues as a fire appeared to them and rested on each of them.

OK, so what about this fire, which we should remember Exodus 3, when the Lord appears to Moses in a burning bush and the bush is on fire, but it's not burning.

Right.

It's just kind of engulfed in flames, but it's not disintegrating.

Then in Exodus 19, 18, Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the Lord had descended on it in fire.

Then in Jeremiah 23, 29 is not my word like fire declares the Lord and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces.

So these descriptors are clearly attached to scriptural ideas and the Lord of attached to scriptural ideas of power in the presence of the Lord.

And we also get here in Acts 2, verse 3, fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.

What a blessing this is.

And a promise from our Lord and Savior that the very presence of our Lord dwells on each and every one of us.

Who, to steal from the words of Peter, repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.

And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

In the Old Testament, when people were filled with the presence of God, they prophesied, which the word prophesy really means to speak forth the word of the Lord.

So they were filled with the Holy Spirit and they began to speak in these other tongues.

What are these other tongues?

Again, a spot where we need to detach ourselves from individual religious experience, myself included.

And if we dig into some of Jewish history around the time and we find this lovely book called the Mishnah, which the Mishnah is a collection of Jewish oral traditions and that was put together in the second century and was passed down from, again, all these oral traditions that was put together in the second century.

The Mishnah in the section on marriage and family.

And we get this section that's about festivals and how they should be gone about, how sacred texts should be read and recited.

And the rabbis distinguish between these, a holy tongue and other tongue.

So in the Mishnah, again, this is rabbi rabbinic tradition that was comprised in the second century.

So the century after all this, we get this understanding that the holy tongue of Hebrew, that at certain festivals, at certain times, the holy tongue of Hebrew should be used and proclaimed.

So the certain services go about in a holy tongue, in the holy tongue of Hebrew.

And then there are other things that are to go about in other tongues, in whatever language you spoke.

And one of the festivals that was listed to be recited in the holy tongue of Hebrew was the festival of first fruits.

What we're looking at here, this day of Pentecost.

I bring this up to say that Luke could be mentioning these other tongues simply in reference to how the festival was supposed to be taught.

How the festival was supposed to be conducted.

How the scriptures were supposed to be recited in the holy tongue of Hebrew.

And the apostles were speaking in other tongues, in other languages, not Hebrew.

Because we know that they spoke in other languages, not Hebrew.

Because that's what the text tells us.

Verse 5.

Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.

And at this sound the multitude came together and they were bewildered, because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language.

So Luke tells us that they were there from Jews, there were Jews from every nation.

Which we'll get to that list shortly.

And Luke's point that they heard a sound and came together because they heard many different languages.

And they heard people speaking in their own language.

So what was the sound that caused them all together?

Was it a rushing wind or was it the actual proclamation of the mighty works of God?

We could probably agree to the latter.

That's probably why they all came together.

And they were amazed and astonished, saying, Are these, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?

And how is that we hear each of us in our own native language?

So what we don't really understand here, all these years later, But if I could compare to how kind of the Galileans were perceived in their time, It would be similar to how we might see some people from like the, some like deep Louisiana occasions.

Just some real like Creole, like Theovan type of people.

Like, Galileans, they were this blue collar back country working type of crew.

And they had a very specific accent.

So the Jews from all around recognized their, these accents.

And here they are speaking in like proper English, you know, Or like speaking their, a specific language with the right dialect and the right pronunciation.

And they were amazed and astonished.

They were like, how does, how does he know like my specific Greek or my specific Aramaic?

How does he know this?

They were amazed.

It reminds me of the videos you see on, on social media.

Maybe you've seen these, maybe you've not.

But like, I, I see these all the time where these like white guys will be in China and they'll go to a Chinese restaurant, which I guess would just be a restaurant.

So they go to a restaurant and they start speaking in perfect Mandarin.

And the whole restaurant is just like, have you guys seen those videos before?

Where if you haven't, don't waste your time.

But anyways, it's just, they're, they're amazed.

They're like, what is like, how is this white guy?

How is he speaking perfect Mandarin?

It makes little sense.

Very little sense.

And they're amazed.

And they're speaking to us in our own language.

Uh, Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretians and Arabians.

We hear them telling in our own tongue, the mighty works of God.

Kind of a fun fact here, but through all these nations mentioned, there's maybe two or three languages that were sort of all spoken, but very similar to Spanish speaking people.

Like they have their own dialects and they have their own, you know, Spanish is the language of many nations, but they have their own dialects and they have their own slang.

And so same sort of type of thing works here.

And they were all amazed and perplexed saying to one another, what does this mean?

But others mocking said they are filled with new wine and new wine meaning strong wine.

New wine is the strong wine.

They heard the mighty works of God in their own language and they were amazed and perplexed.

What does this mean?

What is going on?

And of course, Peter tells them what it means.

And we read his sermon, his beautiful sermon.

But what are we supposed to take away from all this today?

And to answer that question, I want us to go back to the main verse, the sort of purpose verse, the theme verse of the whole book of Acts.

Acts one, eight, but you were, but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit is come upon you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.

What do we see in this passage?

In this passage, we see the power of the Spirit fall upon his people and they begin to be his witnesses in Jerusalem.

We see the start of what Jesus said and promised happen here in this second chapter.

It's beautiful.

And so what does the day of Pentecost show us?

What is this day of Pentecost, this whole thing?

What does this show us?

First, it shows that Jesus can be trusted.

If you need any other reason for us to see that Jesus can be trusted, here's a scene.

He told the disciples to go and wait in Jerusalem.

They went and waited in Jerusalem.

And then 10 days later, the Spirit fell upon them and they became witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

And not only did the Spirit empower their words, he also emboldened their actions.

They began to speak up.

How did we find the apostles after Jesus died and was buried and resurrected?

What were they doing?

They were hiding.

They were fearful.

They said, stay away from Jerusalem.

Why?

Because that's where Jesus died.

And if they were Jesus' people, then surely the Jews were going to come after them too.

They were hiding.

They were fearful.

They were afraid.

But the Spirit came upon them.

And their hiding turned to boldness for the witness of Jesus Christ.

The Holy Spirit empowers His people to be witnesses.

Church, I pray that we would be emboldened to be witnesses of Jesus Christ.

That we would be witnesses of His power and His saving and His mighty works.

You have been given a voice to be a witness.

You have received the Spirit.

So who are you witnessing to?

Who are you witnessing to?

Who are you witnessing to?

For some of us, for some of us, it might be our children.

Where they're actually becoming of an age where they can understand certain things.

And this isn't a debate of when children actually come to salvation.

But they're actually understanding and they can actually wipe their butts.

And they can actually understand something more than just Paw Patrol.

It might be that.

It might be being a witness to a co-worker or a friend.

Who are you witnessing to?

I heard this acronym that I thought would be helpful as we pray through people in our life that we can be witnesses to.

The acronym is BLESS.

So, BLESS your heart.

I'll explain it.

But I just thought this was helpful as we begin to think through, like, how can I intentionally be a witness to the people around me?

How can I intentionally be a witness to those who do not believe?

First, we need to begin with prayer.

We need to begin with prayer.

What is it that you are praying for to be a witness of Jesus?

It might be a person.

It might be a couple.

It might be two or three people.

It doesn't have to be a super long list.

You don't have to think about everyone.

And as you're going through the grocery store and the person who checks you out, you're like, oh, I'm going to add them to my list.

Maybe it is, but maybe it's not.

But begin with prayer.

The next we need to listen and ask questions.

Listen and ask questions.

We should seek to understand before being understood.

We seek to understand before being understood.

Why?

Because Jesus always asks questions.

And we can share better when we listen.

A simple question that you can ask is, Hey, do you have a faith?

Do you have a faith?

Are you religious at all?

Next, we need to eat.

How often do we see Jesus going to a meal, eating a meal, or leaving a meal in the scriptures?

Always.

Always.

Being hospitable is a superpower, and you can do it.

So we need to begin with prayer.

We need to listen and ask questions.

We need to eat.

We need to serve.

Find a way to serve them.

When you go to the birthday party, stay late and help clean up.

Take their kids so they can go out to a dinner and hang out uninterrupted.

Find a way to serve them.

Then lastly, when the opportunity comes, you've got to actually share the gospel and share your story.

And if you've listened and asked questions, you're going to get information and details of their life.

And you're going to find the spot where your two lives intertwine.

And you go, oh, and that's actually the spot where I found Jesus.

Where Jesus helped me and where He showed me.

Man, this is really great for witnessing, but I just think some of us, maybe we even need to apply this in our relationships and in our marriage.

We need to begin with prayer.

We need to listen and ask questions.

You need to actually listen and ask questions, not for a rebuttal, not so that you can have your response already going in your head.

But you need to listen and ask questions of your spouse.

You need to eat together with your spouse.

Sometimes with kids, but definitely without them.

Find a way to serve your spouse.

What's something that they're carrying and holding on to that you can help with?

Who knew this was also supposed to be a lesson on marriage?

You're welcome.

You don't need another tongue.

You don't need another language to share the gospel.

God has given you your English language with whatever accent, with whatever education, with whatever God has given you.

He gave you your voice to proclaim His message and the truth of who Jesus is.

So what are you waiting for?

Who are you to be a witness of?

And who are you going to bless?

Would you pray with me?

Spirit, would you convict our hearts so that we may be your witnesses?

We desire to be used by you and for your purposes.

And if that is not our heart, may you convict us.

And show us that that is the purpose of why you have saved us so that we could be your witnesses.

You have saved us not just to get to heaven, but to be your witness in the places that we already are.

So would you empower us, Holy Spirit, embolden us just like you did back then.

We thank you, Spirit, that you are in us and with us.

Would you be with us as we go?

It's in Jesus' name.

Everyone said, Amen.

Amen.

Amen.
