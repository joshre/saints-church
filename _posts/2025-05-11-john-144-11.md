## Transcription

Alright, good morning again and happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there.

Much love.

Thanks for always doing what you do.

And boys, this is a special Mother's Day message.

I'm just kidding.

It's just, John chapter 14.

Why don't we read verses 1 through 11.

John chapter 14, 1 through 11.

We'll continue on this journey through the book of John and we'll finish it eventually.

But...

And you know the way to where I am going.

Thomas said to him, Lord, we do not know where you are going.

How can we know the way?

Jesus said to him, I am the way and the truth and the life.

No one comes to the Father except through me.

If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.

From now on, you do know him and have seen him.

Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father and it is enough for us.

Jesus said to him, have I been with you so long and you still do not know me, Philip?

Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.

How can you say, show us the Father?

Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?

The words that I say to you, I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works.

Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.

Where else believe on the count of the works themselves?

To where I am going.

If we read this verse alone, it could seem like Jesus knows they would know the way and they just missed it.

But if we keep reading, the disciples were at least somewhat confused.

Right?

Verse 5, Thomas said to him, Lord, we do not know where you are going.

How can we know the way?

Thomas, I love this guy.

Of course, if we were to jump back a couple of chapters, we would see Thomas right after he heals Lazarus from the grave.

Then Jesus is like, all right, it's time to go back into Jerusalem.

Then Thomas is like, cool, Jesus, let's all go get killed.

Let's just do that.

Right?

Then here he is.

Jesus is having this conversation with them and Judas just left and leaves the table.

Then Thomas just goes like, Lord, we have no clue what you're talking about.

I like this guy.

I wish I could be a little more upfront and honest when I don't know something instead of just like nodding my head and admitting anyways, that's another sermon for another time.

They don't know where Jesus is going.

So how could they know the way?

Right?

Like Jesus just said to him, hey, I'm going to prepare a place for you.

Go to my father's house.

And they're like, where's your father's house?

Like it seems like they're looking for like specific coordinates, right?

Or a specific spot.

And he's like, Thomas is like, hey, Jesus, could you just like give us some cross streets?

Could you like, like forward us the Google Maps location?

Could you drop a pin?

Do something.

But let's go back, read the text again, because there's, there's some miscomputing happening here.

So let me read these first five verses to us and we'll see.

Let not your hearts be troubled.

Believe in God, believe also in me, in my father's house are many rooms.

If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?

And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself that where I am, you may be also.

And you know the way to where I am going.

Thomas said to him, Lord, we do not know where you're going.

How can we know the way?

So Jesus tells them he's going to the father.

Right?

And he will come again to take his disciples to the father.

So there is no need for the disciples to know the destination because Jesus just told them, I am going to come back and get you and I will take you to the father.

So just know the way.

Thomas asks, how can we know the way?

Verse six, Jesus said to him, I am the way and the truth and the life.

No one comes to the father except through me.

The way we interpret verse six must be in context of this conversation and the real question that Thomas has.

And that question is, how can we know the way?

Which probably means Jesus is putting emphasis on the word the way.

Right?

So what Jesus is most likely saying is Jesus is the way to God because he is the truth of God and because he is the life of God.

Right?

Jesus says, I am the way and the truth and the life.

No one comes to the father except through me.

And Jesus is putting an emphasis, since the emphasis is in the conversation, on the way to God.

So it's almost as if Jesus is saying, I am the way to God because I am the truth of God and because I am the life of God.

Let's break that down.

Jesus is the truth of God.

John one verse 14, and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only son from the father full of grace and truth.

Jesus is the truth of God because he himself embodies God.

Jesus does what God does and says what God says.

John chapter five verse 19, so Jesus said to them, truly, truly, I say to you, the son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the father doing for whatever the father does that the son does likewise.

Jesus is the truth of God because whatever God does, Jesus does.

Whatever Jesus does, God does.

Jesus is the truth of God because in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God.

Jesus is God.

Jesus is the life of God.

John chapter one verse four, in him was life and the life was the light of men.

Jesus is the life of God because he has life within himself.

John chapter five verse 26, for as the father has life in himself, so he has granted the son also do have life in himself.

Jesus is the life of God because he is the resurrection and the life.

John chapter 11 verse 25 and 26, Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life.

Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live.

And everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.

And only because Jesus is the truth of God and the life of God, can he say he is the only way to God.

Later we'll see Jesus say, if you don't believe my words, believe my works.

In John's gospel, he has put this whole thing together, proving that Jesus is the word of God, fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, and that Jesus is the life of God.

He is literally living, breathing God, God in a bod, right?

That is Jesus.

And John has given us this book, 14 chapters in so far, and he's proven these two points, that Jesus is the life of God and Jesus is the truth of God.

And only because Jesus is the truth and the life of God, can he say that he is the only way to God.

Jesus in context of this conversation that we're looking at this morning, that Jesus is the only way to his father's house.

Jesus is the only way to heaven.

So to answer Thomas's questions, Jesus is the way to God because he is the truth of God and he is the life of God and no one can get to God except through Jesus.

It's so exclusive, that's so harsh and so mean for Jesus to say that he is the only way to God.

Yeah, he is God.

As we've been talking about with our kids of these catechisms, going through punishment, how there was our sins to be paid for, that Jesus came to pay for our sins, right?

His atonement, his work on the cross pays for our sins.

Jesus raised from the grave.

So whatever Jesus says I think goes.

And I'm sorry to our other friends of different religions and of different beliefs.

But Jesus claimed, he said, that he is God.

And he said, if you don't believe my words, believe my works.

And we can't go see Jesus's, well we could go see Jesus's grave, but he wouldn't be in there.

The stone has been rolled.

Number seven.

If you would have known me, you would have known my father also.

From now on, you do know him and have seen him.

I'm going to handle that second sentence and then we'll go back to the first sentence.

What is Jesus saying?

If you have seen me, you have seen God.

That's, that's crazy.

But again, his word and his works back it up.

Now when I read the first part of this verse here, I can add some unwarranted emphasis and maybe add a little spunk and drama that Jesus is probably not implying in the text, right?

I want to read it like, if you had known me, Thomas, if you really knew me, that's how I want to read it.

If you had known me, you would have known my father also.

Little sass, little spunk.

It's probably not how it was originally said.

It's probably, it's probably better read like, if you have come to know me, you would know my father also.

And then Philip replies, Lord chose the father and it's enough for us.

Philip is like, yo, Jesus, I'm totally tracking with you.

Everything sounds good.

Like, yeah, spot on.

You're the way to God.

Like the truth through the life.

I totally, I'm with you.

But like, could you just like show us the father and we'll be like totally chill?

Like just this one thing, just like, come on.

I haven't asked him much lately, other than to be at your right hand.

But if you could just show us the father, like we'd totally be cool.

These guys, they know Jesus, right?

They've lived with him.

They've been with him for the last few years and they know him well.

But what is probably not clicking for them yet is that God has made himself known through Jesus, this person that they are with.

And that feels like, obviously it's completely different because I did not actually walk and talk with Jesus, but that feels like a lot of growing up.

It feels like a lot of maturing is, yeah, I know Jesus.

I know God, but there's just this, my own desires.

There's these things that I do.

There's a lack of maturity.

There's a lack of understanding that I do not understand who I'm actually in relationship with.

I do not fully understand the power of my sin, the weight of my sin.

I truly do not understand what Jesus has done and is doing, what he's done for me, what he's continuing to do in and through me.

And even the older I get, I still don't fully understand that.

And it's happening in real time with these guys.

And Jesus said to him, verse 9, Have I been with you so long and you still do not know me, Philip?

Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.

How can you say, show us the Father?

Do you not believe that I am the Father and the Father is in me?

The words that I say to you, I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works.

You can almost hear the sadness in Jesus' tone with these guys.

His disciples, they've spent so much time with him.

And are they too in the dark?

Are they too not fully understanding?

What does Jesus tell us?

Jesus' disciples believe that Jesus is in the Father and that the Father is in Jesus.

We believe in this thing called the Trinity.

We can see it in the text.

And although we can't fully understand it, we can't fully even describe it, Jesus calls us to believe that he and the Father are one.

A disciple believes that Jesus is in the Father and the Father is in Jesus.

Verse 11, believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.

Or else believe on account of the works themselves.

Okay, so Jesus now tells his disciples, believe him.

You're asking these questions.

I'm not going to give you, I'm going to directly answer your question, Thomas.

I am the way, the truth and the lie.

No one comes to the Father except through me.

I will answer that question.

But you want to see the Father, you've seen me.

What am I calling you to do?

Believe me.

Believe in me.

That's what Jesus is telling his disciples.

That the Father is in Jesus and that Jesus is in the Father.

And for his disciples in that room, believe in the works of Jesus if nothing else.

You've witnessed all these miracles I've done.

You're about to witness the greatest and biggest miracle when I take the cross in a few chapters.

And so not only is he saying his past works, but he's also telling them believe in the works to come.

And for us today, we must continue to believe in Jesus' word and his works.

We must believe in his word that Jesus is the only way to God.

Why?

Because he is the truth of God.

Because Jesus embodied truth.

This book that we're reading from, the Bible, it is truth.

It has been handed down to us.

It has been written down, not exactly to us.

We were not the audience that it was written to, but it was written for us so that we could believe the words of Jesus.

But not only his word, but then also that we could believe his works.

Of course, the best work would be the work of salvation, right?

Jesus' greatest work of all.

But also the works of how he continues to care for us.

How he continues to show up for us.

As we've sang this morning, he won't fail.

He has never failed.

I can remember super early on in ministry, and I was, I actually had just graduated college.

And I was in between jobs, and I was about to start this internship for church, and I had no money.

I remember I had $20 in my bank account, and I needed to fill up a tank of gas.

And so I put in the money that I had into my tank, got me like half a tank.

And then I remember I was actually on my way to church, it was for an event.

And I was praying like, God, I don't have any money.

You saw.

I spent my last bucks on, in my tank account, in my gas tank, in my tank account.

That's what I'm gonna start calling my gas tank.

That's my tank account.

It's full, it's maxed out.

And I was on my way to church, and they had told me like, yeah, you'll get your check in like the next week or two, we'll actually have it for you at the church.

And I remember I was like, God, you see my bank account and my tank account.

One is full, but the one, I guess I need both of them to be full, but you know, God.

And yeah, I was just like praying in my car.

I remember leaving the Arco on Douglas Avenue, and I was driving to the church and I get a phone call.

It's like, hey, Nate, this is whoever from HR.

We have your check.

It's right here ready for you.

And I remember I was like, well, this is crazy.

Like I literally have no money.

I didn't think I was gonna be getting money for a week or two at the end.

And then they had it there for me.

And I was like, I'm driving and I'm into.

And there are time and time again have I seen God show up and God provide and God protect and God discipline when I've needed it.

Sometimes we don't like to talk about the discipline of Jesus, the discipline of God, right?

His rod and his staff, they comfort us.

His rod that was a correction stick for shepherds to save his sheep, to move his sheep.

Sometimes we don't like to talk about the rod of Jesus that protects us, rebukes us, disciplines us.

But man, I am grateful for the discipline from God who I did not like it in the moment, but I've seen it as his protection over my life.

I've seen it as him willing, willing me back to his will, not mine.

So today, do you need to be reminded of the words of Jesus?

What are the scripture we just read today that he is preparing a place for us?

That we have heaven waiting for us, that Jesus has prepared for us?

Do you need to be reminded and filled with hope today that Jesus is coming back for us?

Or do you need to be reminded of his works today?

Do you need to be reminded of his saving grace for us?

How he saved us?

Or how he cares for you and for me?

How he has never left us, has never forsaken us?

Just like a good shepherd cares for his sheep, so Jesus cares for us.

What do you need to be reminded of this morning?

Do you need to be reminded of his word or his works?

Maybe you need a little bit of both.

We have such a gracious God and such a good Savior to us.

May we trust in his word and trust in his works.

Would you pray with me?

Jesus, we thank you for your word.

We thank you for scriptures that you have divinely protected throughout generations.

The fact that we have a Bible, it should be mind-boggling to us, and yet here we are looking at it on screens, on phones.

The fact that we have your story written, that in and of itself is a miracle.

We thank you that you speak to us through your word.

Holy Spirit, would you impart on our hearts scriptures and words that you have for us this morning?

Whether it be the words that we've read or maybe scriptures that we've memorized as Little kids or throughout our adulthood, would you bring those scriptures into our hearts right now?

And may your word comfort us.

May your word challenge us.

May your word convict us.

And Father, we thank you for your works.

We thank you Father for sending your son Jesus to be the ultimate and final sacrifice that you saved us through your life, death, and resurrection, Jesus.

We thank you for that amazing work.

May we never get over that amazing work.

May we continually be reminded of the miracle of our salvation.

And also help us to see and notice how your word is true.

How your word says that, so you care for the lilies in the field.

How much more do you care for us?

Father, help us to see the little things that you provide for us on a daily basis.

Those things are not little, but those things are your works at work in our daily lives.

We thank you Father.

You are so good to us.

We are undeserving of your grace, of your mercy, of your salvation.

And so we thank you that we could come together this morning, gather, sing praises, and be reminded that your word is true.

That you are true, Jesus.

That your works are true.

And you haven't stopped working.

Thank you, Jesus.

We pray these things in your name.

Amen.

Amen.
