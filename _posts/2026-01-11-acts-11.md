<p>In this sermon we cover Acts 11. As we see summary of the gospel spreading to the Gentiles, and the journey of Barnabas looking for Saul. </p>

## Transcription

All right, well good morning.

It's good to see everyone, and good to see you.

Last week it felt like the plague had hit our whole church.

And so it's good to see you here.

And last week we covered Acts chapter 10.

Last week we covered Acts chapter 10, and you're in luck because the beginning part of Acts chapter 11 is essentially a summary of Acts chapter 10.

And so if you missed last week, and you didn't listen to the podcast of the message of Acts chapter 10, God has shown his favor upon you.

You get a pass just this once.

Yeah, so we find ourselves in Acts chapter 11, and why would I give a summary of Acts chapter 10 when we can just read Acts chapter 11.

So turn there in your Bibles.

I'll read for us part of it, and then we'll continue on.

Typically we go verse by verse, but through most of the book of Acts, we've been looking at it chapter by chapter.

A little quicker, a little skip in our step, huh?

So let's just carry on, my wayward son.

Acts chapter 11, verse 1.

Yeah, wow, intense.

Okay, so the news of salvation to the Gentiles has now spread back to the believers in Jerusalem.

And there was a certain sect of them, the circumcision party, who wanted to see Christians, as we'll see later in chapter 11.

They get that name, phrase, they begin to be called Christians.

But these Jesus believers want to see them converted to Judaism through the act of circumcision.

And so Peter gets back to Jerusalem, and this circumcision party, they sit him down in a dark room, put a spotlight on him, and they're like, Where were you three nights ago?

Who were you with?

And why do you smell like bacon grease?

Verse 4.

But Peter began and explained it to them in order.

Verse 5.

I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me.

Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air.

And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.

But I said, By no means, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.

But the voice answered a second time from heaven, What God has made clean, do not call common.

This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.

So Peter tells his vision to these people, whoever he's talking to, this circumcision party, which I'm going to stop calling it that, because at any rate.

So these guys who confront Peter, he tells them of this vision of these unclean animals and the animal blanket covering the earth, and how this voice told him to kill and eat.

And Peter refuses, but then the voice says, What God has made clean, do not call common.

Verse 11.

Verse 11.

So now Peter tells them of how Cornelius sent for him, and he brings up his buddies who he brought with him from there in Joppa, and he's like, Hey, I had witnesses.

I did not do this alone.

I was not acting alone.

But he shares with them how this Cornelius man had an angel sent to him, and essentially how the gospel is going to be shared to him.

And when Peter began to speak, emphasis there on when he began to speak, the Spirit fell on these people, just like on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2.

And it's the important thing to emphasize is not necessarily the Spirit falling on Pentecost, but the important thing to note is that Peter says, As I began to speak, as I began to speak, Peter did not finish his sermon, and then the Spirit fell, like there was something special about Peter's sermon and his delivery.

No.

As he began to speak, this plan of salvation to the Gentiles was God's plan.

And by God's actions, not by Peter's words or remarks.

And our Pentecostal brothers and sisters would use, this is one of the passages they used to show us how the Spirit fell again, just like at Pentecost, arguing what happened to Cornelius should be expected in the Christian life today.

And the reason for that is we have evidence of this through the speaking of tongues.

And I would argue that the Spirit fell in the same way at Pentecost to show a oneness within the body of Christ, a oneness within Jesus, a oneness in the body, a oneness in the bride.

And as Paul will tell the Corinthians, there is one baptism, one Spirit, one body.

The signs of that are through the gift of tongues, which we have seen in Acts multiple times.

It starts in Acts chapter 2 with, of course, the day of Pentecost.

And then we see it again in Acts chapter 7 with the Samaritans.

And then we see it again with the Gentiles in Acts chapter 10.

And each of these markers, each of the signs that follow is essentially a new boundary being crossed and not a repeated individual experience.

These are church-defining moments.

Big C, capital C, church-defining moments.

Not personal templates for us today.

Verse 16.

And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.

If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?

If you remember Peter in Acts 2, when he's preaching after the Spirit falls, he quotes Joel 2, 28 and 29, which says, And it shall come to pass that I will pour out my flesh on all...

Sorry, I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.

Let me read it again.

Got a little ahead of myself there.

And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.

Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions, even on the male and female servants.

In those days I will pour out my Spirit.

And so, as Peter has declared at Pentecost, that the Spirit of God is being poured out on all flesh, that didn't just mean Jew flesh, just on the Jews, but on Gentiles.

With the salvation and falling of the Spirit on these Gentiles that we saw in Acts chapter 10, the prophecy has been fulfilled.

And just as the Spirit fell on them at Pentecost, this is the inclusion of the Gentiles within the covenant family of God.

And what does Peter clearly say here?

He says, verse 17, If then God gave the same gift to them as He gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?

He's like, hey, this was not my idea.

I was not trying to seek out the Gentiles.

This was God's will, God's plan.

Not my own.

And so, we either jump in the boat or don't let the door hit you on the way out.

Verse 18, When they heard these things, they fell silent, and they glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to eternal life.

The first thing that I want to mention with this verse is, they remained silent.

Another way of translating this is, they abandoned their objections.

So, in other words, they were convinced of Peter's argument, and we're like, alright, cool.

Let's go.

This text also gives us an interesting perspective on repentance.

Right?

Then to the Gentiles, also God has granted repentance.

God has granted repentance.

I almost crossed it out there.

Don't want to do that.

God has granted repentance that leads to eternal life.

Yes, repentance is an action, but repentance is also God's gift to us.

It has been given to us by God.

It's not just a way for us to feel guilty and change.

Repentance is God's gift to us.

Okay, let's carry on.

Verse 19.

Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.

Okay, so now we're going to get this missionary report from Luke.

And even in the midst of the fog of persecution and the scattering of the persecution of Stephen and then the scattering of the believers all throughout the land, the gospel was advancing.

But they kept it within their own race.

They kept it with their other Jews.

Verse 20.

But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists, also preaching the Lord Jesus.

Hellenists, those are Greeks.

And Antioch was one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire.

And this would become a great launching point for Paul and his missionary journey, as we'll get to towards the end of this chapter.

But you've got to think like big city, major economical hub in Rome or in the Roman Empire.

And so this is like a very important city.

When I think Antioch, I think of this drive-through city in California.

There's a few Antiochs all across the United States.

None are worth mentioning.

And so when I see Antioch here, I have to give a little bit of context there because I immediately write it off.

But this was a very important city.

Verse 21.

And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.

Okay, so these Jews who are sharing the gospel freely, not just with other Jews, but with Gentiles, they're showing no discrimination to the Gentiles.

The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number turned to the Lord.

So the hand of the Lord was with them, and they experienced some amazing growth.

And it might be common for us to think that the hand of the Lord equals growth.

But I think we know that not to be completely true.

Yes, sometimes the hand of the Lord is on something, and it grows.

But also, sometimes the hand of the Lord might be off something, and it still grow, and it still flourish.

We can look at a lot of people and places where the hand of God might not be on that thing, but yet it grows.

We cannot dumb down the hand of God to our simplistic understanding.

It's not a one-to-one type of thing.

But here we see the hand of the Lord was on them, and it growed.

Praise God.

Verse 22.

The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.

When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad and exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose, for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith.

Okay, so the church grow throughout all of these cities, and this region gets back to the church in Jerusalem, and they send out Barnabas to be an encouragement and a bridge builder for all of these churches.

And again, Barnabas means son of encouragement, and so he encouraged these churches and believers to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose.

Okay, verse 25.

So when Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch for a whole year, and they met with the church and taught a great many people.

And in Antioch, the disciples were first called Christians.

I had mentioned just a bit ago how Barnabas, his name means son of encouragement, and how he's also this kind of bridge builder.

And here in this verse, we see those two things come to life.

The text tells us that Barnabas went to go look for Saul.

And again, we have to remember there's no email, there's no easy way to get connected via social media, there's not even a phone call, can't even send like a carrier pigeon, right?

Barnabas had to go 130 miles to look for Saul.

He's like, hey, last I remember Saul being was, he was in this area of Tarsus.

And so I'm going to go look for him.

I'm going to take an eight day journey and just go look for him.

This kind of reminds me of being a kid growing up, and I don't know if you had this experience or not, but when you would, you know, you had your neighborhood kids, and so you would go and walk to your friend's house, you'd knock on the door, mom or dad would, maybe would answer the door, and you'd be like, hey, can Timmy come out and play?

This is what it reminds me of, but instead of it just being a few houses down the road, 130 miles of travel and journey did Barnabas go to find Saul.

And he found him.

Praise God.

So they go back to Antioch and teach and lead the church in Antioch.

Okay, so why did Barnabas go get Saul?

You have to remember, Saul was a Jew, but he was, he grew up in Tarsus and he was very fluent in Greek and he was like the perfect guy for this job.

He was, he had his upbringing in the Roman world.

And so here is Saul just in the perfect fit of this, one of the largest cities, and he would have the opportunity to spread the gospel to so many believers or so many people, but also be able to teach the believers what it looks like to follow Jesus, right?

To show them Acts 2.42, and they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer.

Right?

Like, could you, could you imagine being one of these new believers, hearing the gospel for the first time, whether you are a Jew or you're a Gentile?

We see this struggle with the Jewish Jesus believers and how they immediately go back to following Jesus in a Jewish perspective, or maybe you're a Greek and you worship however many gods and you just bring Jesus into that picture.

They needed this training.

They needed this correction.

They needed to learn of what it meant and looked like to follow Jesus.

And thank God we have the scriptures preserved for us and given to us.

So we don't, we might have questions and there's different interpretations and different things and theology and doctrine and questions like that, but we're not having to fight over the basics and understanding of what Christianity is, of what it means to have a biblical worldview.

The text also tells us this is the first place where the believers were first called Christians.

And this was not out of love and affection that these people were calling them Christians.

Most likely the Romans used this term to categorize these believers as a religious group.

And the word translated, the Christian, it translated, it means one who belongs to Christ or a Christ person.

And if I could think of an illustration, like it, like it's might how, it might be like how I might refer to like a vegan person.

It's not usually in a very respectful way.

Sorry, said the quiet part out loud.

But you have, but again, you have to think these people have all their gods and here come this new group of believers who are following this Jesus Christ person.

Like who, this, who's this Jesus Messiah?

Like, oh, okay, he rose from the dead.

That's cool.

Like, stay away from those weirdos.

Go get his steak.

You know?

Verse 27.

Now in these days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch and one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there was a great famine over all the world.

This took place in the days of Claudius.

So, the disciples determined, everyone according to his ability to send relief to the brothers living in Judea and they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.

This, the text doesn't give us much details on Agabus and the whole famine thing and so let's not dig too much into him.

The important part here is the believers of different regions and areas were sharing together.

This community of faith was helping their fellow brothers and sisters who were not a part of their local congregation but shared with them anyways.

And as we begin to land the plane this morning, I want to bring our attention back to Acts 11 verse 22 and the verses to follow.

And they sent Barnabas to Antioch.

When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose for he was a good man full of the Holy Spirit and of faith.

We've mentioned this a couple times but Barnabas.

This man right here.

Son of encouragement.

Some of us are natural encouragers.

Like we just you know, we glass half full just like you got this.

You're awesome.

You rock. some of us are those people.

I try to be most of the time, not all the time.

But some of us are just naturally encouragers.

And some of you maybe Eeyore is more like your spirit animal.

Whatever sort of the spectrum you might fall on.

What words are coming out of your mouth towards others? what words are coming out of your mouth towards others?

Especially to the ones you love.

Are you uplifting?

Are you encouraging?

And I want us to notice here what Barnabas encouraged them in. he exhorted or encouraged them to all remain faithful to the Lord.

What's a what's a big deal to you in your home?

What's a big deal to you?

Are you encouraging the people in your home?

Kids, spouse, the people you even interact with on a day-to-day basis. basis?

What's important to you?

Are you encouraging them in the good things?

In the godly things?

Or just correcting behavior?

I know a lot of us have young kids here so I'm going to focus in on that for a second.

But I think we can all extrapolate this and think about it from a broader context.

But should you discipline your children?

Yes.

Should discipline be important in the home?

Should order be important in the home?

Should kids be able to understand and recognize authority and respect authority?

Yes.

But is it all behavior modification?

Or are we also celebrating and encouraging and pointing out some positive things?

Like when they memorize a Bible verse.

When they memorize their catechism.

Or they do something Christ-like towards you or towards a sibling.

The other day, and like she's six so gotta remember that.

I pull Ivy to the side and I didn't say a word yet.

She started crying.

And then I had to ask her hours later but I was like did you did you think just because I was pulling off to the side you were in trouble?

She said yeah.

And I know that's not the truth but there is some truth in that.

And it was revealing to me of like oh man.

How often are the words coming out of my mouth towards my children just correction? thing.

But then I mean I just to be honest I have to think of what words am I saying to myself?

I don't know about you but I want to be a person who is encouraging others especially to remain faithful to the Lord.

Is that something you you're thinking about it?

Are we uplifting one another?

Are we pointing each other back to Christ? it is so important.

It is so valuable.

Why?

Because how easily do we lose focus?

How easily do we forget our purpose?

How easily do we get distracted by the things around us by the stuff in life but when we are encouraging others towards Christ?

How much easier is it to do that when you have people when you have a person who is uplifting and encouraging you towards the things of Christ?

And not just that because that's swinging way too far the pendulum there needs to be a balance we need to look at things realistically but we also need to be encouraging one another in the things of Christ because it is fuel to the fire and there's two ways to look at this you can either go well nobody does that for me or I kind of hate this saying but it works now be the change you wish to see in the world yeah I wish somebody was doing that for you but you can either choose to look at it from that angle or you can go you know what forget that I'm going to choose to do it for somebody else I'm going to choose I'm going to choose that instead I'm going to I'm not going to focus on what I wish was happening for me I'm going to control what I can't control and instead of focusing on that I'm going to do that for somebody else and so this week text somebody a scripture man I was reading this and I thought of you love you you rock praying for you tell somebody how much they mean to you maybe you want to write a little note send them a text message a little post it on the mirror I don't know but tell somebody how much they mean to you do something nice for somebody like these are all simple things that we can all do have all probably done but it's like anything we need to go back to the simple things he exhorted them to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose this again he wasn't going through certain types of maybe they got there but the text doesn't highlight how he was going through specific doctrines and specific systematic theologies and how one thing works into the next remain faithful to the Lord remain faithful to the Lord encouraging one another into the Lord Acts chapter 11 we see the spreading of the gospel to beyond the Jews to the Gentiles praise God because I'm not a Jew we see the words of Jesus beginning not beginning they've always been true but we see them working themselves out in real time you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to the ends of the earth and of course at this point the gospel had not spread yet to the ends of the earth we're still trying to do that today but we see it working itself out we see God working and increasing and speaking and breathing and moving and doing only what God can do and using different people there were some people who did not get mentioned by name in this text but yet they were doing what God had called them to do and so as we think about this text as we think about this week coming up and as we think about this year what would it look like for us to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose not get focused on some of these other things that do matter do have some weight but let's get really good at the fundamentals let's get really good at the basics and remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose would you pray with me Jesus we thank you for who you are we thank you that we get to study your word we thank you that you have given us people in our lives who we get to interact with and Lord these people are a blessing our children are a blessing and so would you help us to be encouragers would you help us to focus in on being uplifting to encourage one another in the things of Christ because you are most important and so let us not neglect the most important thing to the most important people in our lives we love you Lord we thank you for this time together it's in Jesus name everyone said amen and amen thank you for joining us this morning it's good to see you have a great week and we'll see you next Sunday
