## Transcription

All right, good morning.

Hope you're well this morning.

We are in Acts chapter 16 this morning.

But before we move forward into Acts 16, let me just kind of recap Acts 15.

We have the Jerusalem Council, as it might be subheaded in your Bible, and awesome chapter.

One of the main things about Acts 15 was the integration of the Gentiles into the church, the Gentiles being non-Jews, as the people of God through the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.

There is one body, one flock, one shepherd, and Jesus, he is bringing together those who have been called to him, both the Jew and the Gentile.

But the issue at hand was that, some of the Jewish Christians wanted to see the Gentiles be converted to Judaism, mainly through circumcision and adopting the Mosaic Law as the rule of life.

And so we had the Apostles, the elders of some of the main churches, and leaders gathered together, and through the interpretation of the Old Testament and the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the early church, they concluded that, that that was unnecessary for Gentiles to become Jews.

And so now we turn the page to Acts 16.

And so let's read the first five verses together.

Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra.

A disciple was there named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek.

Um, first things first here.

Don't be this dad who's just known for his ethnicity.

Like, in a few moments we're going to see he's well spoken of and he was well known, but later in the scriptures Paul will talk about how his mom and grandma were amazing people, but he has nothing to say about that.

His dad.

And what a challenge for us men and dads that we not just be known for what we are, but we should be known for who we are, the actions that we do, the things that we say, the leadership that we bestow and give to our family.

This isn't just, uh, yeah, praise God for Timothy and the work that he's going to do through the life and power of the Spirit.

But I don't want to be known as a father who's just an American.

I want to be known for far more than that.

And so what am I doing as a man, as a husband, as a father, as I lead my family?

Verse 2.

He was well spoken of.

By the brothers at Lystra and Iconium.

Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him.

And he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places.

For they all knew that his father was a Greek.

As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decision that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.

So the churches were strengthened in the faith and they increased in numbers daily.

Okay.

So Paul, what are we just talking about in Acts 15?

Paul, the rest of the church leaders just fought for Gentiles not to be circumcised.

And now here we are a chapter later, just like the next story later, and Paul is going to circumcise Timothy.

Like, what gives?

So the text tells us, right, that Timothy, there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek.

If this were Harry Potter, Timothy is a mudblood, right?

For those of you who follow Harry Potter and watch Harry Potter, if not, that just went over your head and now here I am digging myself a ditch.

So Timothy, he's not fully Greek, not fully Jew.

He's mixed, right?

But to the Jews, Timothy is a Jew because his mother is a Jew.

And so since he was not circumcised, he would have been looked at like an apostate Jew.

Like, this is a Jew who is not following the law.

He has, like, why is he, we shouldn't even be gathered with this Jew.

This was like a dividing factor.

And so since it was well known that his father was a Greek, this would have been a major issue in his ministry and his gospel work.

This has nothing to do with salvation.

This has nothing to do with what the disciples were discussing.

The last chapter and this whole Jerusalem Council, this has everything to do with Timothy specifically and the fact that he has Jewish bloodline in him, that he was a Jew, his mother was a Jew, he was raised probably in the Jewish, in the synagogue, and yet he's not circumcised.

That would have been an issue.

Another question I have is, how did they know?

But that's another sermon for another time.

Timothy gets circumcised.

And they get going on their mission.

And the churches were strengthened in the faith.

And they increase in number daily.

Just something, a personal thing here.

This last week, I had the opportunity to go to a pastor's gathering.

And I met some pastors here in town that are leading some great churches, some that you've heard of, some you've never heard of.

And it was an amazing encouragement to me.

And it should be to you that the gospel is advancing in our city.

That the name of Jesus is being honored and glorified all over our city.

And so that should strengthen you in the faith, to know that there are amazing churches all around our city who are praising Jesus alongside with us as we gather together this morning.

So praise God for them and we pray for them.

A couple if you want to pray for specifically, Mascot Baptist Church, that's in Mascot, Tennessee.

Their pastor there is Zach.

He's been there for about two years.

Another church you can be praying for is Island High.

Island Home Baptist Church.

Lonsdale Community Church.

Great church.

Two Rivers was there.

The pastor of Two Rivers was there.

Christ Covenant Church.

There you go.

So shouting them out.

Some amazing pastors and leaders leading those churches.

Let's continue.

Verse six. "And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia and, when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia.

But the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.

So passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas, and a vision appeared to Paul in the night.

A man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, 'Come over to Macedonia and help us.' And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them." Again, a lot of cities mentioned in these verses, so let's go back to the map.

Okay, let me get here and here.

Okay, so the region of Phrygia.

So this is where we're starting over here.

Phrygia, this is where they were.

Phrygia, Galatia.

And having been forbidden to go into Asia.

Sorry, Asia.

This is modern day Turkey, just so you know where we're at.

This right here is the Mediterranean Sea.

So they were forbidden, by the Holy Spirit, to speak the word in Asia.

And so then what do they do?

They kind of like, okay, if we're not going to go in Asia, we're going to go around.

And so they kind of travel up here, right?

And we see they had come up to Mysia, the region of Mysia.

And they attempted to go into Bithynia, right here, like Istanbul is like right over here.

And modern, obviously modern day.

Istanbul is right over here.

So they couldn't go this way, to Bithynia, but the spirit of Jesus did not allow them.

So they pass through Mysia and then end up in Troas, which is just right over here.

And then they'll end up going to this little island city of Semalthrace and end up over here in Macedonia, Neapolis.

Again, this over here would be modern day Greece.

So their travels, this whole journey here.

Was about 250 to 300 miles, all of this over here.

It would have taken them three to four weeks of travel to get to Troas.

Get down to Troas over here.

And then another 150 to 200 miles at sea.

So lots of travel there, taking lots of time.

And again, that's three to four weeks if Paul isn't going to stop and preach the gospel somewhere and hang out for a few days and raise up churches and leaders and do all those things that he wants.

That he would do from place to place.

And so this could have taken a long time.

Pretty cool stuff there.

Okay, so when we get into the content of these travels, what we actually see here in the verses is we see Paul abandoned his plan, right?

He wanted to go into Asia.

He wanted to go into Bithynia.

But for whatever reason, the Holy Spirit was preventing him or forbidding him to move toward Asia.

Now, was this just some sort of feeling?

Was this a gut feeling?

Was there like a literal physical barrier that he came up against?

Like they reached the border of Mysia and Bithynia and he's like stepping and it's just like there's this like force field or something that he can't pass through.

We don't know.

But the passage mentions twice that the spirit would not allow them to go.

And so this is a good reminder to us to hold our plans, our ideas.

Our wants, our jobs and desires to hold them loosely.

Because when the spirit starts speaking, we better start listening.

Also, important note here is we better have community around us and people around us that can speak into these types of decisions.

People who know the scriptures and can help you help you filter out what is truly the spirit speaking, because let's be reminded that the spirit.

Spirit will never contradict the book that he wrote.

Let me say that again.

The spirit will never contradict the book that he wrote.

So keep people around you, your church who can help you filter out what is the spirit speaking and what was last night's pizza.

That's exactly what we see Paul do here in verse nine and ten.

Paul has this vision.

And in the original language in the Greek, there's this kind of togetherness and this agreement that is not quite.

Rendered fully in the English translation that we see for us.

But there was a it was almost a communal decision.

What we see is Paul.

He he tells them of this vision and says, hey, I have this vision of this man in Macedonia.

And it says they all agree.

They all came together and agreed that they were to go to Macedonia.

So very important here that we understand and know that there is this sort of communal this this togetherness.

It wasn't just a one man kind of show that Paul was like leading and charging.

Yes, he was sort of leading and charging, but there was a communal decision here.

One last thing of these verses.

Let's look at verse six and ten together.

Verse six and and they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.

Now jump down to verse ten and when Paul had seen the vision vision immediately.

We sought to go into Macedonia.

So in verse six, we see they pronouns in verse ten, we see we pronouns.

It is believed that between these travels between the region of of Phrygia and Galatia and this travels here all the way to Troas that somehow Luke, the writer of this book of Acts and also the writer of the Gospel, Luke, he actually joined the region of Phrygia and Galatia.

He joined the region of Galatia.

He joined in the travels and he actually joined in with the missionary journey here with Paul and Timothy and Silas.

And so that's why we see this pronoun change go from they to we because we was actually there.

Luke was actually there.

Luke joined the missionary journey and he is now an eyewitness on this missionary journey.

And as the text says, immediately they went into Macedonia.

So we can continue verse 11.

So setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace and the following day to Neapolis and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city in the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony.

We remained in this city some days and on the Sabbath day, we went outside the gate to the riverside where we supposed there was a place of prayer.

And we sat down and spoke to the woman who had come together, one who heard us was a woman named Lydia from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God.

The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.

And after she was baptized in her household as well, she urged us saying, if you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.

And she prevailed upon us.

And so they get into the region of Macedonia and more specifically, Philippi, which would have been an incredibly wealthy city.

It's on the coast.

A lot of goods being traded through the city.

And in verse 13, verse 13 tells us it's the Sabbath day.

Now, something we have to be reminded of is that Paul would have tried to acquaint himself with whatever sort of Jewish community and presence would have been in that city.

And so he would meet the people at the synagogue.

But Paul calls it a place of prayer.

And what is noted is that.

It is outside of the city next to a river.

We don't know if this was sort of an open air kind of venue or what the exact like synagogue look like, if it even was a full synagogue.

We also don't know if both men and women were there at the same time and the men didn't want to talk to Paul and his crew.

And so this woman, Lydia, goes up to him and starts listening to him.

But in verse 14, we get this line.

The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.

The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.

Another thing to note here is that the text tells us that she was a worshiper of God.

This is very similar language to what we see in chapter 10, that is used to describe Cornelius.

And we know what happens with Cornelius and his whole family of he was a Roman centurion and he gets radically saved.

And the first sort of.

Noted salvation that we see of of the Gentiles and a Gentile family.

And so the assumption could be here that we get very similar language describing Cornelius and Lydia is that she might be a Gentile who worshiped Yahweh, who worshiped the Jewish God.

And it says she listened, but the Lord opened her heart to pay attention.

You probably at one.

Point or another have been in church and for whatever reason on that Sunday, things just clicked.

You had that aha moment where you could understand and God opened your heart to salvation or he opened your heart to a deeper understanding of something.

And I believe that is what we are seeing here in the text.

She heard the good news of Jesus Christ and she repented, believed and was baptized in her household as well.

And I believe that is what we are seeing here in the text.

She heard the good news of Jesus Christ and she repented, believed, and was baptized in her household as well.

And I believe that is what we are seeing here in the text.

She heard the good news of Jesus Christ and she repented, believed, and was baptized in her household as well.

And I believe that is what we are seeing here in the text.

She heard the good news of Jesus Christ and she repented, believed, and was baptized in her household as well.

And I believe that is what we are seeing here in the text.

She heard the good news of Jesus Christ and she repented, believed, and was baptized in her household as well.

And I believe that is what we are seeing here in the text.

She heard the good news of Jesus Christ and she repented, believed, and was baptized in her household as well.

And I believe that is what we are seeing here in the text.

She heard the good news of Jesus Christ and she repented, believed, and was baptized in her household as well.

I pray for us all whether that be for salvation, that one would repent of their sin, recognize their need for a savior, and believe in Jesus Christ as the one true living God. and believe in Jesus Christ as the one true living God.

Whether it be salvation or that God would reveal himself to us through the conviction of sin or a deeper understanding and love for Christ, I pray that we all would have the Lord open our hearts for Christ, I pray that we all would have the Lord open our hearts for Christ, I pray that we all would have the Lord open our hearts to him. to him. to him.

Let's continue verse 16.

Let's continue verse 16.

Let's continue verse 16. "As we were going to the place of prayer, "As we were going to the place of prayer, "As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a we were met by a slave girl who had a we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination spirit of divination spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by and brought her owners much gain by and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling. fortune-telling. fortune-telling.

She followed Paul and us, crying out, She followed Paul and us, crying out, She followed Paul and us, crying out, "These men are servants of the Most High "These men are servants of the Most High "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of God, who proclaim to you the way of God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation." salvation." salvation." And this she kept doing for many days.

And this she kept doing for many days.

And this she kept doing for many days.

Paul, having become greatly annoyed, Paul, having become greatly annoyed, Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the Spirit, "I turned and said to the Spirit, "I turned and said to the Spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ command you in the name of Jesus Christ command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out of to come out of her." And it came out of to come out of her." And it came out of her that very hour. her that very hour. her that very hour.

Now we're introduced to this slave girl Now we're introduced to this slave girl Now we're introduced to this slave girl who, by all accounts, is demon-possessed who, by all accounts, is demon-possessed who, by all accounts, is demon-possessed and has the ability to fortune-tell. and has the ability to fortune-tell. and has the ability to fortune-tell.

And she was pretty popular because her And she was pretty popular because her And she was pretty popular because her owners made lots of money from her. owners made lots of money from her. owners made lots of money from her.

So this slave girl is following Paul So this slave girl is following Paul So this slave girl is following Paul and company around, and she says, and company around, and she says, and company around, and she says, "These men are servants of the Most High "These men are servants of the Most High "These men are servants of the Most High God who proclaimed to you the way of God who proclaimed to you the way of God who proclaimed to you the way of salvation." salvation." salvation." And she followed them around four days.

And she followed them around four days.

And she followed them around four days.

Like, that Like, that Like, that that would be so annoying. that would be so annoying. that would be so annoying.

But when we read this, like, we think, But when we read this, like, we think, well she's she's not wrong right like she's saying these men are servants of the most high god who proclaim to you the way of salvation which like to us we go like yeah god jesus holy spirit trinity three in one yeah these guys are servants of the most high god and yeah they are proclaiming the way of salvation but to a greek who worshipped many gods there were many gods to a jew they're thinking yahweh they're not thinking jesus christ she's saying this and it is just so vague like which god like for us you might hear a muslim say oh yes god is good praise god we're talking about different gods that's the same thing here could be zeus could be poseidon could be any of these greek gods they're using the same words just one is actually worshiping the true god and so paul who is greatly annoyed not only does he correct her but he does so specifically he says in the name of jesus christ we go from god like later in acts we'll see paul with the romans and he says you have all these gods and you even have this idol to the god who is an unnamed god i'm going to tell you about that unnamed god we we see paul go from or we see the situation go from very vague very sort of god yeah spirit you know this very sort of we would consider new age i've got these crystals and there's this i have this spirituality about me and it's just all these it's out there and paul goes specific no it's jesus christ and in the name of jesus christ so as she is speaking indirectly paul speaks directly and announces who he is a servant of who the most high god is and who is the way to salvation and as the text says came out of her that very hour this is one of those scenes that one day when we get to heaven i hope we get to like find the tivo or whatever and like turn it back and watch this one just a powerful scene and so what comes of it verse 19 but when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone they seized paul and silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers and when they had brought them to the magistrates they said these men are jews and they are disturbing our city they advocate for customs that are not lawful for us as romans to accepted practice the crowd joined in attacking them and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods and when they had inflicted many blows upon them they threw them into prison ordering the jailer to keep them safely having received this order he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in stocks so now we see the response of the slave girls owners and they are very upset they grab paul and silas they drag them into the sort of city square and they put them in some sort of almost public trial saying that they are disturbing the city which is debatable especially since you've got this slave girl who's going around and repeating herself over and over again we could we could debate who was actually disturbing the city but their accusations of advocating for customs that are not lawful are somewhat true worshiping jesus was not against the law but it sure would have been an attack on roman identity and roman culture and so yeah there's some there's some truth to that so their plan works and the crowd starts attacking and the leaders of the city rip off paul and silas's clothes and they start beating them and whipping them and then they were beaten and thrown into the inter uh enter prison and fasten their feet in stock so they get thrown in prison and then verse 25 tells us about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god and the prisoners were listening to them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bonds were unfastened when the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open he drew his sword and was about to kill himself supposing that the prisoners had escaped but paul cried with a loud voice do not harm yourself for we are all here and the jailer called for lights and rushed in and trembling with fear he fell down before paul and silas then he brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved so paul and silas they're locked up in this inner prison cell and what is their response after being beaten and thrown in prison to pray and to sing that's just insane if that were me i'd be crying right doing anything i could to just like feel normal but to pull from paul and his letter to the church that will become of philippi philippians what does paul say rejoice in the lord always again i say rejoice imagine being one of these prisoners hearing these guys pray and sing you'd be looking at your fellow soulmates like what is up with these dudes these guys are psycho talking about this dude jesus christ and then here they are they're just like praying and singing and they just got beat and whipped and they're just and they're praying and singing and it doesn't sound half bad like what is going on these guys are cuckoo and then an earthquake happens could you the chains come off your arms and legs and you're like what what's up with these guys now the sleeping jailer wakes up and he sees the rubble and the mess from the earthquake and he's like well i've just failed at my job draws his sword and his punishment for these prisoners being escaping probably would have been death and so he's just cutting to the chase but then paul's yells like stop don't do it we're all here so the jailer fetches for the lights and turns the lights on and immediate his immediate response is to fall down with fear before paul and silas and asks what must he do to be saved so within the record roman culture earthquakes would have been attributed to the gods so when the jailer is kneeling before paul and silas he could be essentially like pleading his case before the gods like going like what must i do to be safe like you've guys got something going on here i don't know what's happening but uh help me the jailer also would have known that these guys were in for some sort of religious crimes and so maybe he made a quick connection that these guys have some sort of favor or power with the most high god we should also consider the fact that paul and silas were singing so the jailer probably heard whatever hymns they were singing and praying and some he probably formulated some sort of belief or at least some sort of he had some sort of structure for who these people were another thing to note is that the jailer would have lived on site at the prison so um we could assume here that from the aftermath of the earthquake the jailer made this demonstration not in private but that his whole household and the other prisoners were witnessing this exchange between paul silas and the jailer verse 31 and they said believe in the lord jesus and you will be saved you and your household and they spoke the word of the lord to him and to and to all who were in the house and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds and he was baptized at once he and all his family then he brought them up into his house and set food before them and he rejoiced along with his entire household that he believed in god what saves you do your works save you this being a good a good person save you whatever that means no the only thing that saves you is belief in the lord jesus christ the lord opened the hearts of this jailer and his household and they believed and were baptized and now he starts caring for paul and silas he starts cleaning their wounds and this is not typical behavior for a jailer back then prisoners families and friends they would be the ones who provide food and and help for the jailers and so for the jailer to actually do this he's not only is he acting outside of the normal but he's also acting courageously and his actions if they were to be found out could be costly to him verse 35 but when it was day the magistrate sent the police saying let those men go and the jailer reported these words to paul saying the magistrates have sent to let you go therefore come out now and go in peace but paul said to them they have beaten us publicly uncondemned men who are roman citizens and have thrown us into prison and do they now throw us out secretly no let them come themselves and take us out the police reported these words to the magistrates and they were afraid when they had heard that they were roman citizens so they came and apologized to them and they took them out and asked them to leave the city so when they went out of the prison and visited lydia and when they had seen the brothers they encouraged them and departed okay so the morning comes the magistrates conclude that the punishment that they put on paul and silas was sufficient and sent word to release paul and silas and now paul discloses that he is a roman citizen which could lead to the question why were you holding that information and when you had just already been beaten up and we can't say for certain but we know from first thessalonians that paul will say that he was shamefully treated in philippi and so the fact that they were beaten publicly not given legal due process was not only illegal for a roman citizen but also would have been shameful the law also protected roman citizens from flogging and from imprisonment so the magistrates response of apologizing and kind of like walking everything back makes sense of them being afraid since if paul were to take this up with a higher court that these guys would be in the wrong so they asked paul to leave the city but uh they visit lydia and the other believers to encourage them before they go now in the last few minutes here as we close i just want to ask the question is the lord opening your heart or maybe how is the lord opening your heart even in the last few minutes here as we close i just want to ask the question is the lord opening your heart or maybe how is the lord opening your heart how is the lord opening your heart even in the last few minutes here as we close i just want to ask the question is the lord opening your heart or maybe how is the lord opening your heart even in the last few minutes here as we close i just want to ask the question is the lord opening your heart or maybe how is the lord opening your heart even in the last few minutes here as we close i just want to ask the question is the lord opening your heart even in a group this size i'm sure he is even in a group this size i'm sure he is and it could be in a multitude of ways and it could be in a multitude of ways for some the lord is opening your heart for some the lord is opening your heart just like lydia and leading you to just like lydia and leading you to salvation salvation to repent from your own ways in your own to repent from your own ways in your own life and to believe in jesus christ that life and to believe in jesus christ that he is the way to eternal life that he he is the way to eternal life that he saves rescues redeems and restores he saves rescues redeems and restores for some of us the lord is opening our for some of us the lord is opening our hearts to respond to trials and hardship hearts to respond to trials and hardship just like paul and silas just like paul and silas just like paul and silas through prayer through prayer through prayer and praise and praise and praise you know we never know who is listening you know we never know who is listening you know we never know who is listening and watching and watching and watching as we pray as we pray as we pray and praise and not just in this room and praise and not just in this room and praise and not just in this room but you never know who is watching you but you never know who is watching you but you never know who is watching you as you persevere through incredibly as you persevere through incredibly as you persevere through incredibly difficult situations difficult situations difficult situations like think about this the text mentions like think about this the text mentions like think about this the text mentions that the other prisoners heard that the other prisoners heard that the other prisoners heard paul and silas praying paul and silas praying but who was the one who was saved the but who was the one who was saved the but who was the one who was saved the jailer jailer jailer we never know who around us we never know who around us we never know who around us is seeing us respond to difficult is seeing us respond to difficult is seeing us respond to difficult situations we never know who around us situations we never know who around us situations we never know who around us by simply just being encouraging or by praying with someone or by asking or by praying with someone or by asking or by praying with someone or by asking how someone is doing and actually how someone is doing and actually how someone is doing and actually sitting and listening sitting and listening sitting and listening we never know who is being affected we never know who is being affected we never know who is being affected by the way we act we never know who is being affected by the way we act by the way we treat people and so while paul and silas were praising and so while paul and silas were praising and so while paul and silas were praising they had no idea who it would affect they had no idea who it would affect they had no idea who it would affect their only response was prayer and praise their only response was prayer and praise their only response was prayer and praise and this jailer and his whole family and this jailer and his whole family and this jailer and his whole family were saved were saved were saved you don't have control over all of life you don't have control over all of life you don't have control over all of life circumstances but you do have control circumstances but you do have control circumstances but you do have control over your response the words actions and over your response the words actions and over your response the words actions and attitude you have in the midst of hard attitude you have in the midst of hard attitude you have in the midst of hard times times times and that has effect not just
