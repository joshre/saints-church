## Transcription

John chapter 11, and, uh, yeah, why don't we, if somebody wants to read, uh, we can do the whole chapter.

We're new here.

We're new in this chapter.

We're new in these parts.

John 11, correct? 11.

Okay.

Now, a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.

It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.

So the sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, he whom you love is ill.

But when Jesus heard it, he said, This illness does not lead to death.

It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.

Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.

So, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was.

Then, after this, he said to the disciples, Let us go to Judea again.

The disciples said to him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?

Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.

But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.

After saying these things, he said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.

The disciples said to him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.

Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest and sleep.

Then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus has died, and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe.

But let us go to him.

So Thomas, called the twin, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.

Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.

Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off.

And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.

So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house.

Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.

Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again.

Martha said to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.

Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection of my life.

Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live.

And everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.

Do you believe this?

She said to him, Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.

When she said this, she went and called her sister, when she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, The teacher is here, and he is calling for you.

And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.

Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.

When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.

Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled.

And he said, Where have you laid him?

They said to him, Lord, come and see.

Jesus wept.

So the Jews said, See how he loved him.

But some of them said, Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?

Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb.

It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.

Jesus said, Take away the stone.

Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead for four days.

Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?

So they took away the stone, and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.

I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around that they may believe that you sent me.

When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out.

And the man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips and his face wrapped with a cloth.

Jesus said to them, Unbind him and let him go.

Many of the Jews, therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him.

But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.

So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council and said, What are we to do?

For this man performs many signs.

If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.

But one of them, Caiaphas, who was a high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all, nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.

He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.

So from that day on, they made plans to come to death.

Jesus, therefore, no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there to the region near the wilderness to a town called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples.

Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves.

They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, What do you think, that he will not come to the feast at all?

Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know so that they might arrest him.

Awesome.

Quite the scene here.

And we'll start back from the beginning, John 11, verse 1.

Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.

It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.

So the sisters sent to him saying, Lord, he whom you love is ill.

So if we take a step back to the last couple of verses of John chapter 10, we get the full scope of where Jesus is.

In John 10, 40, it says he went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained.

So Jesus had left Jerusalem and the surrounding area of Jerusalem, which of course tells us Bethany was about two miles, actually less than two miles outside of Jerusalem.

And Jesus had gone over to the Jordan where John the Baptist was baptizing and that's where Jesus was.

And so Lazarus is sick and Mary and Martha send for someone to go to Jesus to inform him that he's sick.

And then verse four tells us, but when Jesus heard it, he said, this illness does not lead to death.

It is for the glory of God so that the son of God may be glorified through it.

So this verse here reminds me of Jesus healing the blind man in chapter nine, where it says, where Jesus says, uh, in regards to the blind man, this man is not blind from the sin of him or his parents, but that the work, uh, works of God might be displayed in him.

So we kind of already get this sort of tease of like, Ooh, is, is something else about to go down?

And surely it is.

Lazarus dies.

That's what happens.

Um, now verse five, now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.

So when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was.

Okay.

So we get this again, we get, uh, this sort of, uh, foreshadowing of Jesus, loving these people, loving this family, loving these brothers and sisters, Martha and Mary, not mother.

Mary, Mary, his mom, Mary, his mom, but this family unit here of Mary, Martha sisters and their brother, Lazarus.

And we see that, uh, uh, Jesus heard that, uh, Lazarus was sick.

He also said, uh, he also said it was for the glory of God.

And so that the son of man, uh, might be glorified through it.

And so what does Jesus do?

He waits two days, um, which we don't have an explicit answer of to why he waited these two days.

Um, but it was sort of a customary thinking of the time of rabbis that, uh, after someone dies, the body, the soul, the person's soul hovers over their body for three days.

That was the thinking of the time that someone dies and their soul hovers above their body for three days.

And so then when we get to verse 17 and it says that Lazarus had been dead for four days, then the thinking of the time was that Lazarus was dead, dead, like D-E-D dead.

Like he's, he's toast, right?

He's all done.

Yes.

Perfect.

Uh, he is, he's done.

Um, so that's probably why we get this, why Jesus waited there for two days.

Um, maybe, I mean, again, this is completely speculation.

Maybe Jesus knew that this was the official beginning of the end.

Like he knew, okay, I go, I'm going to go heal Lazarus.

And then like Passover's coming.

Like it's, it's about to go down.

Like this is the very beginning of the end.

So we don't, again, that's complete speculation, um, as to why Jesus waited those two days.

But in context to the story, it kind of seems like the three day hovering soul thing.

Um, whatever that is.

Yep.

Anyways, but it also gets me thinking, um, have you ever been in a situation where you wished God would have shown up immediately?

Our buddy Silas right now, I'm sure wishes God would have shown up immediately.

Um, yeah, me too.

I wish he'd show up for him immediately.

But I think, uh, as we look at this, I've got this little caveat for us and then got one at the end.

But as we look at this and think of this, uh, Jesus, God being part of the Godhead is clearly okay with us being sad, with us mourning, with us feeling the feelings of whatever disappointment, with whatever disappointing situation and scenario that we might find ourselves in.

Either now, in the past, either now, in the past, or in the future.

Jesus is okay with us feeling those feelings.

And he doesn't need to rush to a situation.

We don't, we feel like we need him to rush, but he does not need to rush to a situation.

Why?

Because he can see the full picture.

He can see the full story.

He is outside of our time and space.

And so our feelings, our circumstances, and even death do not scare Jesus.

Why?

Verse 4.

It is for the glory of God so that the Son of Man, so the Son of God may be glorified through it.

Of course, he is specifically talking about Lazarus and this situation.

But I believe those words to be true about the things we go through in our own lives.

Verse 7.

Then after this, he said to the disciples, Let us go to Judea again.

The disciples said to him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you.

Don't you forget why we left the city?

And are you going there again?

Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble.

But he sees the light of this world.

But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles because the light is not in him.

So Jesus, again, right?

My little synopsis here.

Jesus waits these two days after hearing the news of Lazarus.

And then he says, Autobots, roll out.

Right?

And then the disciples are like, Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Hold up.

Like, Rabbi, did you not forget?

They wanted to kill you.

They want to stone you.

They want to get rid of you.

Let's chill.

Like, let's let this de-escalate a little bit more.

Then we can get back into it.

And then Jesus responds to them in this sort of time equation.

Right?

He says, there's twelve hours in the day.

If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of the world.

But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles because the light is not in him.

So before watches and before – yeah, before watches and before they really counted time, day was split into two halves.

We have when it's light, which was twelve hours, and when it's dark for twelve hours.

And then we created this thing called daylight savings time, which works, I guess.

That's funny.

I didn't even put two and two together until I woke up this morning.

And then we're talking about time.

Okay, I'm getting stuck.

So there's twelve hours of light, twelve hours of darkness.

And the light essentially meant work, right?

You work during the day.

You don't work at night.

So we have this contrast of twelve hours to work and twelve hours of rest.

And Jesus is using this – essentially using this metaphor saying, as long as I'm doing my father's work, as long as I'm in the light, as long as I'm operating in my father's work, I am safe.

And therefore, the disciples are safe as they follow their shepherd.

If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, right?

The stumbling would be the insecurity, if you will.

I'm walking in the light.

I'm doing my father's work.

I am safe.

You're safe.

We're fine.

If we walk in the night, we stumble.

If we don't do the father's work, we stumble.

Verse 11 continues.

After saying these things, he said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.

The disciples said to him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.

Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest and sleep.

Then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus has died.

So Jesus tells them why they're going back to Bethany.

It's because Lazarus died, but the disciples do not fully compute.

So, ah, he's asleep.

He's fine.

He'll have some great rest.

We can see him in a few more days.

It's cool.

Then Jesus tells them just flat out, he's dead and I'm going to go wake him up.

Verse 15.

And for your sake, I am glad that I was not there so that you may believe, but let us go to him.

So, ah, Jesus essentially says to the disciples, I am glad that I was not there so that you can witness my power and authority, even my power and authority over death.

Now let's go.

Verse 16.

So Thomas called the twin, said to his fellow disciples, let us all go that we may die with him.

You just got to love the honesty of Thomas here.

And this story especially is one where I wish we could hear and see the body language and the tone of voice because it's just lost in the text.

Um, was Thomas being sarcastic?

Like, come on guys, let's all just go and die with him.

Let's just go.

Or was, was he speaking with resolve and determination?

Knowing like, okay, Jesus is our guy.

And like, he's going into, to Jerusalem.

And like, we're going to go fight, fight the Jews, fight Rome.

And we're going to overthrow Roman authority, right?

Because that was a lot of the assumption of the time of what the Messiah would do, that the Messiah would come and conquer.

So is, is Thomas like, come on, like, let's go.

Like, it's time to fight.

Like, we're ready to fight.

Or was it more of like a sarcastic, like, I don't want to die.

We don't know.

Uh, this is also the same guy, Thomas, who after Jesus's death is like, I won't believe you until I stick my fingers in the scars of Jesus.

So, he's, he's, uh, quite the character.

Verse 17.

Now, when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.

Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off.

And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.

So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him.

But Mary remained seated in the house.

We talked about the significance of those four days earlier and, uh, also along this time, many of the Jews, as was kind of customary, to come and mourn with, uh, with the family and sort of make a spectacle out of it.

Uh, and with Martha and Mary over the death of Lazarus.

And Martha then goes out to greet Jesus as she hears he's coming.

Um, of course, later we hear in John chapter 11 that they, she meets him outside of town.

So they're not yet in, um, town in the village.

Uh, and, but Mary stays back in the house.

And Martha, when she gets to Jesus says in verse 21, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

But even now I know whatever you ask from God, God will give you.

Again, I, I wish we had the tone of voice and, and the body language, um, because I think we see kind of an interesting turn in her verbiage and language of how things are being translated for us and her tone from what seems to me to be disappointment.

Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

Seems to be quite a disappointing statement.

Like, God, I wish you were here.

Jesus, I wish you were here.

Two, but even now I know whatever you ask from God, God will give you.

So we get this, what seems to be this, this shift from disappointment to faith and hope.

Lord, if you had been here to, but even now I know.

Jesus said to her, verse 23, your brother will rise again.

Martha said to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection of the last day.

So Martha makes this admission here that her brother will rise again in the resurrection of the last day.

And for those, uh, who are keeping score, this would make Martha a Pharisee.

She would be under the, uh, pharisaical belief of the end times.

Pharisees believed in the resurrection of the last days, that there would be a resurrection.

The Sadducees did not hold this belief of resurrection.

So there's a distinction there.

If you care, if not, anyways, uh, Jesus says to her, your brother will rise again.

And her response, it can kind of feel like she's heard that time and time again.

It was the Hallmark card equivalent, right, to, uh, your brother, your brother's in a better place now.

He's, he's okay.

Like, so sorry for your loss.

He's in a better place, right?

Like we say that all the time when, when, when somebody dies, uh, here and now.

And she goes, yes, I know that he will rise again on the resurrection of the last day.

So it kind of seems like Martha has this response of, of, uh, yeah, I know.

I know this is, that's the right answer.

That's the right thought.

That's the right belief that he will rise again.

I know that, but I still wish you had been here because you probably could have healed him.

And verse 25, Jesus says to her, I am the resurrection and the life.

Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live.

And everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.

It's almost like Jesus is saying, oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

You misunderstood me.

Let me give it to you straight up.

I am the resurrection of the dead and I am the life.

I am eternal life.

I am the resurrection of the dead and I am eternal life.

Whoever believes in me, though he dies an earthly death, shall he live, be raised through Christ at the last day.

And everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.

There is eternal life in the kingdom of God.

So Jesus says, I am the resurrection.

I'm the resurrection of the dead that even though you die earthly, you will be raised through Christ on the last day.

You will be raised through Jesus on the last day and the life.

Everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.

There is eternal life in the kingdom of Christ.

Jesus continues and asks her, do you believe this?

Do you, Martha, believe this?

When Jesus asked Martha, do you believe this?

He is not asking if she believes that he is about to raise Lazarus from the dead.

Jesus is asking her if her faith can go beyond confidence that her brother will be resurrected in the last day to a personal trust in Jesus that he is the resurrection of the last day. that he is eternal life the only and he is the only person who can grant eternal life and the promise transformation of resurrection.

Jesus is asking her to go from a theological claim I know who he will be raised again on the last day to a personal belief in the man standing in front of her.

Do you believe that I am the resurrection?

Do you believe that I am the life?

To which she replies yes Lord I believe that you are the Christ the son of God who is coming into the world.

That final phrase there who is coming into the world is actually attached to a messianic psalm I believe it's psalm 82 and so even in her response she is responding with a belief that Jesus is the fulfillment of these things.

Her faith is a mixture of personal trust and of confidence that certain things about Jesus are true.

That he is the Christ that he is the son of God and that he is the one who was to come into the world from the branch of Jesse from the lineage of David that he is the one he is the Messiah. this passage gives us a very interesting picture of pain death and suffering we see Jesus not hurry to the scene all the way back in verse 4 we see Martha's disappointment and also an acknowledgement of his power Lord if only you had been here and so the question I have for us today is what's the difference in her pain and suffering versus our pain and suffering what's the difference the Holy Spirit that's the difference Martha needed Jesus to show up physically in the flesh she needed Jesus to show up she admits it right Lord if only you had been here Martha needed Jesus to show up in the flesh and we have Jesus through his sent spirit inside of us the problem is he might not show up how we'd like or at the time frame we would like last week I had some stuff going on that I was really praying through and processing through and I was really just hoping that God would solve it in this certain time frame and he didn't he did end up answering the question that I had but it was not in the way that I expected it or even how I expected it to happen but he did show up many of you know and some may not but Kayla's last delivery with Jaden was quite traumatic and I know for her it left some disappointment some hurt and pain and suffering and there were days weeks months where she questioned one why did God let this happen how how what did I do wrong all these different thoughts questions and emotions and did God show up yes but it was not in the time frame that she wanted the time frame we wanted it was not how we expected it it was not even in the ballpark of how I would have imagined it to be the prayers and and the disappointment and the pain and suffering those things did not get solved even to the way that I I could have thought of or imagined but in that whole process what I saw was commitment and faithfulness to God even when Kayla did not want to was she perfect no but she didn't give up and God showed up in her life and it was on his time and in a way that we both were not expecting why do I tell you this so that you don't give up don't give up it was not a long time for Martha to get from verse 21 Lord if you had been here to verse 22 but even now I know it might take you months or years to get from disappointment to faith and hope but one thing I know is that God is with you he is for you and we must not give up you must cling to the truth of verse 25 I am the resurrection and the life whoever believes in me though he die yet shall he live and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die we must cling to that truth that Jesus is the resurrection that Jesus is the life not cling to the truth of our circumstance or our situation or woe is me life sucks but we must cling to the truth of who Jesus is because he never changes he is faithful when we are faithless he remains and we must continue to respond to the truth like Martha does in verse 27 yes Lord I believe that you are the Christ the son of God who is coming into the world our response to Jesus asking or to Jesus proclaiming I am the resurrection and the life our response to that must be yes Lord I believe that you are the Christ I believe that you are the son of God who has come into the world who rose from the dead and who is coming back again how do we respond to pain disappointment discouragement we respond to it by belief in Christ and you're like really Nate that's that's all that's yes what else are you going to do if everything in this world changes if we change we need to hold on to the truth and not give up on a father who loves us who on a good shepherd who as we just talked about the last few weeks who loves you knows you the craziest thing to me about this interaction with Jesus saying I am the resurrection and life and Martha's belief and admittance on who Jesus is her response to all of this is still while her brother is dead she didn't need Lazarus to come to life for her to believe in who Jesus is what he had done what he will do and so my question in the midst of our pain suffering death even will we believe have faith and trust and continue to follow God even when that disappointment doesn't turn around the truth still remains Jesus is the resurrection Jesus is the life what do we do we run to our father we run to our good shepherd Jesus even when he's outside of the city limits we run to him and we don't give up let me pray for us father we thank you for who you are we thank you that you are a good God that you are you yourself were familiarized with pain and suffering and even death and father I thank you that we can look to your son Jesus as an example and as the truth Jesus we thank you that you came into this world you humbled yourself to this world that is broken and messed up and as scripture tells us it was the joy set before you to take the cross in the midst of our pain in the midst of our suffering may you be our joy because you are joy may you be our peace because you are peace may you be our love because you are love father would you give us the resolve to keep going to not give up to not turn from you Jesus we thank you that you are with us and the good the bad and the ugly we thank you that we can trust you and turn to you and it's in your name everyone said amen amen
