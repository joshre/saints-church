## Transcription

John chapter 11 and yeah, why don't we if somebody wants to read we can do the whole chapter we're new here we're new in this chapter we're new in these parts 11 lead to death it is for the glory of god so that the son of god may be glorified through it now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus so when he heard that lazarus was ill he stayed two days longer in the place where he was then after this he said to the disciples let us go to judae again the disciple said to him rabbi the jews were just now seeking to stone you and are you going there again jesus answered are there not 12 hours in the day if anyone walks in the day he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world but if anyone walks in the night he stumbles because the light is not in him after saying these things he said to them our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i go to awaken him the disciples said to him lord if he has fallen asleep he will recover now jesus had spoken of his death but they thought that he meant taking rest and sleep then jesus told them plainly lazarus has died and for your sake i am glad that i was not there so that you may believe but let us go to him so thomas called the twin said to his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him now when jesus came he found that lazarus had already been in the tomb four days bethany was near jerusalem about two miles off and many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them concerning their brother so when martha heard that jesus was coming she went and met him but mary remained seated in the house martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died but even now i know that whatever you ask from god god will give you jesus said to her your brother will rise again martha said to him i know that he will rise again with the resurrection on the last day jesus said to her i am the resurrection of my life whoever believes in me though we die yet shall he live and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die do you believe this she said to him yes lord i believe that you are the christ the son of god who is coming into the world when she said this she went and called her sister when she had said this she went and called her sister mary saying in private the teacher is here and is calling for you and when she heard it she rose quickly and went to him now jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where martha had met him when the jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw mary rise quickly and go out they followed her supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there now when mary came to where jesus was and saw him she fell at his feet saying to him lord if you had been here my brother would not have died when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who had come with her also weeping he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled and he said where have you laid him they said to him lord come and see jesus wept so the jews said see how he loved him but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this name from dying then jesus deeply moved again came to the tomb it was a cave and a stone lay against it jesus said take away the stone martha the sister of the death of the dead man said to him lord by this time there will be an odor for he's been dead for days jesus said to her did i not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of god so they took away the stone and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank you that you have heard me i knew that you always hear me but i said this on account of the people standing around that they may believe that you sent me when he had said these things he cried out with a loud voice lazarus come out the man who had died came out his hands and feet bound with linen strips and his face wrapped with a cloth jesus said to them unbind him and let him go many of the jews therefore who had come with mary and had seen what he did believed in him but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what jesus had done so the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council and said what are we to do for this man performs in many signs if we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and the romans will come and take away both our place in our nation but one of them kaiaphas was the high priest that year said to them you know nothing at all nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people not that the whole nation should perish he did not say this in his own accord but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus would die for the nation and not not for the nation only but also to gather into one the children of god who are scattered abroad so from that day on they made plans from the death jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the jews but went from them from their excuse me but went from there to the region near the wilderness to a town called epram and there he stayed with the disciples now the Passover of the jews of that hand and many went out from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves they were looking for jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple what do you think that he will not come to the feast at all now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was he should let them know so that they might arrest him awesome quite the scene here and we'll start back from the beginning john 11 verse 1 now a certain man was ill Lazarus of Bethany the village of Mary and her sister Martha it was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was ill so the sisters sent to him saying Lord he whom you love is ill so if we take a step back to the last couple verses of john chapter 10 we get the full scope of where jesus is in john 10 40 it says he went away again across the Jordan the place where john had been baptizing at first and there he remained so jesus had left Jerusalem and the surrounding area of Jerusalem which of course tells us Bethany was about two miles actually less than two miles outside of Jerusalem and jesus had gone over to across the Jordan where john the baptist was baptizing and that's where jesus was and so Lazarus is sick and Mary and Martha send for someone to go to jesus to inform him that he's sick and then verse four tells us but when jesus heard it he said this illness does not lead to death it is for the glory of god so that the son of god may be glorified through it this verse here reminds me of jesus healing the blind man in chapter 9 where it says where jesus says uh in regards to the blind man this man is not blind from the sin of him or his parents but that the work uh works of god might be displayed in him so we kind of already get this sort of tease of like oh is is something else about to go down and surely it is Lazarus dies that's what happens um now verse five now jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus so when he heard that Lazarus was ill he stayed two days longer in the place where he was okay so we get this again we get uh this sort of uh foreshadowing of jesus loving these people loving this family loving these brothers and sisters Martha and Mary not mother Mary his mom but this family unit here of Mary Martha sisters and their brother Lazarus and we see that uh jesus heard that Lazarus was sick he also said it was for the glory of god and so that the son of man uh might be glorified through it and so what does jesus do he waits two days um which we don't have an explicit answer of to why he waited these two days um but it was sort of a customary thinking of the time of rabbis that uh after someone dies the body the soul the person's soul hovers over their body for three days that was the thinking of the time that someone dies and their soul hovers above their body for three days and so then when we get to verse 17 and it says that Lazarus had been dead for four days then the thinking of the time was that Lazarus was dead dead like ded dead like he's he's toast right he's all done yes perfect uh he's he's done um so that's probably why we get this why jesus waited there for two days um maybe i mean again this is complete speculation maybe jesus knew that this was the official beginning of the end like he knew okay i go i'm gonna go heal Lazarus and then like Passover's coming like it's it's about to go down like this is the very beginning of the end so we don't again that's complete speculation um as to why jesus waited those two days but in context to the story it kind of seems like the three day hovering soul thing um whatever that is yep anyways but it also gets me thinking um have you ever been in a situation where you wished god would have shown up immediately our buddy Silas right now i'm sure wishes god would have shown up immediately um yeah me too i wish show up for him immediately but i think uh as we look at this i've got this little caveat for us and then got one at the end but as we look at this and think of this uh jesus god being part of the godhead is clearly okay with us being sad with us mourning with us feeling the feelings of whatever disappointment with whatever disappointing situation and scenario that we might find ourselves in either now in the past or in the future jesus is okay with us feeling those feelings and he doesn't need to rush to a situation we don't we we feel like we need him to rush but he does not need to rush to a situation why because he can see the full picture he can see the full story he is outside of our time and space and so our feelings our circumstances and even death do not scare jesus why verse four it is for the glory of god so that the son of man so the son of god may be glorified through it of course he is specifically talking about lazarus and this situation but i believe those words to be true about the things we go through in our own lives verse seven then after this he said to the disciples let us go to judaea again the disciple said to him rabbi the jews were just now seeking to stone you don't you forget why we left the city and are you going there again jesus answered are there not 12 hours in the day if anyone walks in the day he does not stumble but he sees the light of this world but if anyone walks in the night he stumbles because the light is not in him so jesus again right my little synopsis here jesus waits these two days after hearing the news of lazarus and then he says autobots roll out right and then just the disciples are like wait wait wait hold up like rabbi did you did you not forget they wanted to kill you they want to stone you they they want to uh they want to get rid of you let's chill like let's let this de-escalate a little bit more then we can get back into it and uh then jesus responds to them in this sort of time equation right he says uh he says there's 12 hours in the day if anyone walks in the day he does not stumble because he sees the light of the world but if anyone walks in the night he stumbles because the light is not in him so uh before watches and before yeah before watches and before they really counted time like day was split into two halves we have when it's light which was 12 hours and when it's dark for 12 hours and then we created this thing called daylight savings time which works i guess uh that's funny i didn't even put two and two together until i woke up this morning and we're talking about time here okay i'm getting stuck um so there's 12 hours of light 12 hours of darkness and the light essentially meant work right you work during the day you don't work at night so we have this uh contrast of 12 hours to work and 12 hours of rest and jesus is using this essentially using this metaphor saying as long as i'm doing my father's work as long as i'm in the light as long as i'm operating in my father's work i am safe and therefore the disciples are safe as they follow their shepherd if anyone uh if anyone walks in the day he does not stumble right the stumbling would be the uh insecurity if he will i'm in i'm walking in the light i'm doing my father's work i am safe you're safe we're fine if we walk in the night we stumble if we don't do the father's work we stumble verse 11 continues after saying these things he said to them our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i go to awaken them awaken him the disciple said to him lord if he has fallen asleep he will recover now jesus had spoken of his death but they thought that he meant taking rest and sleep then jesus told them plainly lazarus has died so jesus tells them why they're going back to bethany it's because lazarus died but the disciples do not fully compute so ah he's asleep he's fine he'll have some great rest we can see him in a few more days it's cool then jesus tells them just flat out he's dead and i'm gonna go wake him up uh verse 15 and for your sake i am glad that i was not there so that you may believe but let us go to him so uh jesus essentially says to the disciples i am glad that i was not there so that you can witness my power and authority even my power and authority over death now let's go verse 16 so thomas called the twin said to his fellow disciples let us all go that we may die with him you just gotta love the honesty of thomas here and this is this story especially is one where i wish we could hear and see the body language and the tone of voice because we it's just lost in in the text um was thomas being sarcastic like come on guys let's all just go and die with him let's just go or was was he speaking with resolve and determination knowing like okay jesus is our guy and like he's going into to jerusalem and like we're gonna go fight fight the jews fight rome and we're gonna overthrow roman authority right because that was a lot of the assumption of the time of what the messiah would do that the messiah would come and conquer so is is thomas like come on like let's go like it's time to fight like we're ready to fight or was it more of like a sarcastic like i don't want to die we don't know uh this is also the same guy thomas who after jesus's death is like i won't believe you until i stick my fingers in the scars of jesus so he's he's uh quite the character verse 17 now when jesus came he found that lazarus had already been in the tomb four days bethany was near jerusalem about two miles off and many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them concerning their brother so when martha heard that jesus was coming she went and met him but mary remained seated in the house we talked about the significance of those four days earlier and also along this time many of the jews as was kind of customary to come and mourn with uh with the family and sort of make a spectacle out of it uh and with martha and mary over the death of lazarus and martha then goes out to greet jesus as she hears he's coming of course later we hear in john chapter 11 that they she meets him outside of town so they are not yet in town in the village uh and but mary stays back in the house and martha when she gets to jesus says in verse 21 lord if you had been here my brother would not have died but even now i know whatever you ask from god god will give you again i i wish we had the tone of voice and and the body language um because i think we see kind of an interesting turn in her verbiage and language of how things are being translated for us in her tone from what seems to me to be disappointment lord if you had been here my brother would not have died it seems to be quite a disappointing statement like god i wish you were here jesus i wish you were here too but even now i know whatever you ask from god god will give you so we get this what seems to be this this shift from disappointment to faith and hope lord if you had been here too but even now i know jesus said to her verse 23 your brother will rise again martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection of the last day so martha makes this admission here that her brother will rise again in the resurrection of the last day and for those uh who are keeping score this would make martha a pharisee she would be under the uh pharisaical belief of the end times pharisees believed in the resurrection of the last days that there would be a resurrection the sadducees did not hold this belief of resurrection so there's a distinction there if you care if not anyways uh jesus says to her your brother will rise again and her response it can kind of feel like she's heard that time and time again it was the hallmark card equivalent right to uh your brother your brother's in a better place now he's he's okay like so sorry for your loss he's in a better place right like we say that all the time when when when somebody dies uh here and now and she goes yes i know that he will rise again on the resurrection of the last day so it kind of seems like martha has this response of of uh yeah i know i know this is that's the right answer that's the right thought that's the right belief that he will rise again i know that but i still wish you had been here because you probably could have healed him and verse 25 jesus says to her i am the resurrection and the life whoever believes in me though he die yet shall he live and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die it's almost like jesus saying oh i'm i'm sorry you misunderstood me let me give it to you straight up i am the resurrection of the dead and i am the life i am eternal life i am the resurrection of the dead and i am eternal life whoever believes in me though he dies an earthly death shall he live shall he live be raised through christ at the last day and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die there is eternal life in the kingdom of god so jesus says i am the resurrection i'm the resurrection of the dead that even though you die earthly you will be raised through christ on the last day you will be raised through jesus on the last day and the life everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die there is eternal life in the kingdom of christ jesus continues and asks her do you believe this do you martha believe this when jesus asked martha do you believe this he is not asking if she believes that he is about to raise lazarus from the dead jesus is asking her if her faith can go beyond confidence that her brother will be resurrected in the last day to a personal trust in jesus that he is the resurrection of the last day that he is eternal life the only and he is the only person who can grant eternal life and the promise transformation of resurrection jesus is asking her to go from a theological claim i know who he will be raised again on the last day to a personal belief in the man standing in front of her do you believe that i am the resurrection do you believe that i am the life to which she replies yes lord i believe that you are the christ the son of god who is coming in to the world that final phrase there who is coming into the world is actually attached to a messianic psalm attached to a messianic psalm i believe it's psalm 82 and so even in her response she is responding with a belief that jesus is the fulfillment of these things her faith is a mixture of personal trust and of confidence that certain things about jesus are true that he is the christ that he is the son of god and that he is the one who was to come into the world from the branch of jesse from the lineage of david that he is the one he is the messiah this passage gives us a very interesting picture of pain death and suffering we see jesus not hurry to the scene all the way back in verse four we see martha's disappointment and also an acknowledgement of his power lord if only you had been here and so the question i have for us today is what's the difference in her pain and suffering versus our pain and suffering what's the difference the holy spirit that's the difference martha needed jesus to show up physically in the flesh to show up physically in the flesh she needed jesus to show up she admits it right lord if only you had been here martha needed jesus to show up in the flesh and we have jesus through his sent spirit inside of us the problem is he might not show up how we'd like or at the time frame we would like last week i had some stuff going on that i was really praying through and processing through and i was really just hoping that god would solve it in this certain time frame and he didn't he did end up answering the question that i had but it was not in the way that i expected it or even how i expected it to to happen but he did show up many of you know and some may not but kala's last delivery with jaden was quite traumatic and i know for her it left some disappointment some hurt and pain and suffering and there were days weeks months where she questioned one why did god let this happen how how what did i do wrong all these different thoughts questions and emotions and did god show did god show up yes but it was not in the time frame that she wanted the time frame we wanted it was not how we expected it it was not uh even in the ballpark of how i would have imagined it to be the prayers and and the disappointment and the pain and suffering those things did not get solved even to the way that i i i could have thought of or imagined but in that whole process what i saw was commitment and faithfulness to god even when kala did not want to was she perfect no but she didn't give up and god showed up in her life and it was on his time and in a way that we both were not expecting why do i tell you this so that you don't give up don't give up it was not a long time for martha to get from verse 21 lord if you had been here to verse 22 but even now i know it might take you months or years to get from disappointment to faith and hope but one thing i know is that god is with you he is for you and we must not give up you must cling to the truth of you must cling to the truth of verse 25 i am the resurrection in the life whoever believes in me though he die yet shall he live and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die we must cling to that truth that jesus is the resurrection that jesus is the life not cling to the truth of our circumstance or our situation or woe is me life sucks but we must cling to the truth of who jesus is because he never changes he is faithful when we are faithless he remains faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful when we are faithful must be yes lord i believe that you are the christ i believe that you are the son of god who has come into the world who rose from the dead and who is coming back again how do we respond to pain disappointment discouragement and we respond to it by belief in christ and you're like really nate that's that's all that's yes what else are you going to do if everything in this world changes if we change we need to hold on to the truth and not give up on a father who loves us who on a good shepherd who as we just talked about the last few weeks who loves you knows you the craziest thing to me about this interaction with jesus saying i am the resurrection life i am the resurrection life and martha's belief and admittance on who jesus is her response to all of this is still while her brother is dead she didn't need lazarus to come to life for her to believe in who jesus is what he had done what he will do and so my question in the midst of our pain suffering death even death even will we believe have faith and trust and continue to follow god even when that disappointment doesn't turn around the truth still remains jesus is the resurrection jesus is the life what do we do we run to our father we run to our good shepherd jesus even when he is outside of the city limits we run to him and we don't give up let me pray for us father we thank you for who you are we thank you that you are a good god that you are you yourself were familiarized with pain and suffering and even death and father i thank you that we can look to your son jesus as an example and father i thank you that we can look to your son jesus as an example and as the truth jesus we thank you that you came into this world you humbled yourself to this world that is broken and messed up and as scripture tells us it was the joy set before you to take the cross in the midst of our pain in the midst of our suffering may you be our joy because you are joy may you be our peace because you are peace may you be our love because you are love father would we would you give us the resolve to keep going to not give up to not turn from you you jesus we thank you that you are with us and the good the bad and the ugly we thank you that we can trust you and turn to you and it's in your name everyone said amen
