<p>In this sermon we cover all of Acts 14. Looking at Paul's missionary journey, the continued advancement of the gospel as well as some idol worship and persecution of the believers.</p>

## Transcription

Good morning again.

So yeah, I get the honor and privilege of preaching God's Word this morning, and today, as you can see, we'll be in Acts 14, and this actually marks the halfway point of our journey through Acts, and so for the brief, quick, brief recap of what we've seen through chapters 1 through 14, we've seen the Holy Spirit come down from heaven, we've seen the start of the Christian church, we've seen the death of the first martyr, we've seen a powerful and unlikely conversion of the Apostle Paul, and then we are now currently in the midst of the first missionary journey of Paul and Barnabas.

So all in all, not much has happened.

No, I'm just kidding.

But within it all, we get to see how God is building His church, that He has not left the growth of the church up to chance, or really much less up to us, but He alone is the builder and sustainer of His church, and He's doing this all for His glory, and all of creation and all of history proclaim His glory, and we talk about it a lot, we sing about it a lot today, but like, what does that mean?

Like, what is the glory of God?

Just a quick definition, the glory of God is the radiant display of His attributes, and so the word attributes answers the question, what is God like?

So God's attributes, it includes His self-existence, perfection, holiness, love, omnipotence, meaning all-powerful, omniscience, meaning all-knowing, omnipresence, meaning He's everywhere, justice, mercy, patience, and wrath, among many others, and then the radiant display means that all of this shines before an audience.

So His attributes, and just He Himself, is seen, savored, and celebrated, and to kind of proof out this definition, in Job 38, God explains to Job that He laid the pillars and foundations of the earth while the angels look on with joy.

So angels had no part in creation.

Again, Genesis 1-1, in the beginning was God, and He created the heavens and the earth.

No angels helped, but they got to watch it, and they got to celebrate.

And then throughout Scripture, there's always a constant sense of everything, everyone, pay attention to God's glory.

And for example, Moses in Deuteronomy 32 and 1 and 3, he says, Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak, and let the earth hear the words of my mouth.

I proclaim the name of the Lord, ascribe greatness to our God.

So Moses is calling the heavens and the earth, to listen to him proclaim God's glory, and then for them, likewise, to ascribe greatness to our God.

But however, this sense of everyone, everything, pay attention, also applies to the wickedness and perversity of sin, which is actually ascribing God's glory to ourselves.

Jeremiah 2, God declares, And the foundational purpose of our lives is to glorify God, but then the tragedy of sin, as Paul says in Romans 3, that we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

And really, one translation puts it, we all have lacked the glory of God.

So we have not perfectly displayed the glory of God with our lives.

And then Paul also goes on to say, Romans 1, 25, And so we've traded the glory of being images of God for worthless idols.

So whether that's our own self, material things, or a lowercase g, God that we've built in our mind.

But luckily, even the entrance of sin declares and reveals the glory of God, because his attributes are on full display as he has sent his son to become human.

He lived a perfect life.

Again, he submitted to the wrath that we deserved.

He died in our place and then rose again.

And this is the point of history.

Jesus Christ is the focal point and climax of all of history.

And no act of creation, no act of creation, or praise from angels brings God more glory than the redemption of sinners who will one day stand before him singing his praise because of how he saved us.

And then that leads us to the theme verse of Acts.

So it's Acts 1, 8, And so the purpose of Acts is the witnessing and proclaiming of the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ.

To everyone.

So Acts is calling everyone, everything, pay attention to God's glory because of his act of redemption.

And as we'll see, Acts 14, it's just a brief narrative of this proclamation being done by Paul and Barnabas.

And it also holds timeless lessons for the church.

And then hopefully, kind of through this intro, through the catechism we've done, the songs that we've sang in the psalm, this chapter is about the glory of God.

And one of the things that kept jumping out at me while reading and studying Acts 14 is when Paul and Barnabas, they tear their clothes in response to the crowd's idolatry that we'll see in a little bit.

We'll talk about that reaction.

We'll talk about how much grief they felt, but also how beautiful it was that they responded that way.

And so a quick brief of context.

So chapter 13, Paul and Barnabas, they started in Syrian Antioch.

Oh, yeah, cool.

Cyprus, they went through Perga.

And then now in 13, they were in Pisidian Antioch.

And so what they were doing there, they're in the synagogue, they're preaching, they were revealing the, I guess, how Christ fulfilled all of these Old Testament prophecies.

And then one Sabbath day, a huge crowd comes together, basically the whole city, to hear the gospel be preached.

And then the Jewish rulers are jealous of the attention that this gospel is drawing.

And so they conspire with the influential men and women of Pisidian Antioch.

So again, top left.

And they drive Paul and Barnabas out of the town.

And so Paul and Barnabas, they've traveled to Iconium, which is right there.

That's about 100 miles southeast of Pisidian Antioch.

And this is actually where we pick up in chapter 14.

So we'll go through verses one and seven.

So now at Iconium, they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.

But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.

So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

But the people of the city were divided.

Some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles.

And when an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews with their rulers to mistreat them and to stone them, they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country.

And there they continued to preach the gospel.

So as usual, Paul and Barnabas, they join a group of people in the synagogue, and they begin preaching.

But Luke only gives a description of the outcome of the preaching, just saying a great number of both Jews and Gentiles believed.

And from all the sermons and everything we've seen through Acts, I hope that sounds familiar, that a great number of both Jews and Gentiles believed.

Because as we can see, God is still working and being true to his promise of drawing his children to himself.

And again, it's not the eloquence or like the persuasiveness of Paul's speech that saved these people.

It was the power of his message, because it's the power of the name of Jesus Christ that brings people from death to life.

And because of the nature of the gospel, there were both Jews and Gentiles who united in faith, but also Jews and Gentiles who united in opposition.

And the word unbelieving that Luke uses in verse 2 can actually literally be translated as, disobeyed.

And so as we'll see in this chapter, and like other parts of scripture, belief and obedience go hand in hand, as do unbelief and disobedience.

And then undeterred by this opposition of the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles, and really as the text is saying that it's implied that because of it, Paul and Barnabas, they stay a long time in Iconium.

So they don't hit opposition and then just move on to the next city.

They stay there for a long time.

And so what they're doing, they're correcting the false witness, and slander that the Jews and Gentiles were speaking, and they were speaking boldly for the Lord.

More accurately, they're speaking in reliance on the Lord.

So they spoke boldly because they could rely on the Lord to be true to his promises.

And they were witnessing to the facts of the gospel that Christ came, he died, he rose.

And then what Luke uses to describe this is he calls it the word of his grace.

And it's an amazing definition of the gospel, the word of his grace, because it is a word of grace, because God is giving us what we don't deserve, which is salvation through Christ.

And I guess some definitions of grace is you're getting what you don't deserve.

Mercy is not getting what you do deserve.

And again, a quick survey of humanity and even our own lives.

We do not deserve salvation.

And Luke goes on.

So the Lord granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands as they were preaching.

And once again, Luke is showing the close association between words and signs with signs confirming what is being said.

And so the true use of signs and wonders is to establish the gospel in its full and its perfect authority.

It's to point to the power and person of Jesus Christ.

And then again, in verse four, we see how the gospel both unites and divides.

Some believed the false message of the Jews.

Some believed the words and signs of the Lord.

And then the Jews and Gentiles, they plot to harm and stone.

Paul and Barnabas, they luckily hear of it and they flee to Lystra and Derbe, which is in the Lycaonian province.

And a really fun side note.

So this is a little zoomed in.

So this is where Paul and Barnabas go, Lystra and Derbe.

And so this actually, Luke's saying that they're in the Lycaonian province.

It was a big gotcha verse for historians in like the 19th, 20th centuries.

Because at the time, Lystra and Derbe were in different provinces.

And so if the Bible had an incorrect fact, no matter how small, then it will no longer be error-free.

And then it could really just be thrown out like any old book.

It may have good moral teachings, but if it had an incorrect error like this, it couldn't be called the word of God.

And so there's a man named Sir William Ramsey.

He was actually a Nobel Prize winning scientist and a New Testament scholar.

He won the Nobel Prize for discovering the noble gases.

So like hydrogen, neon, argon, basically everything on the right of the periodic table.

But unfortunately, his theology was to the far left, as he was a liberal scholar and an unbeliever.

And being trained as a scientist, he wanted like physical empirical evidence that what Luke said about Lystra and Derbe was in fact false.

So he followed the same journey that Paul took in Acts to verify like the validity of all these locations that were mentioned.

And so as he was researching, gathering evidence, he actually found that the cities of Lystra and Derbe were in fact in the same province for a period of 35 years.

And it was actually between the years 37 AD and then 72 AD, which is the exact time period that Paul and Barnabas would have visited Lystra and Derbe.

And luckily, by God's grace, Ramsey not only became a believer after this journey, but he also realized that Luke was the most accurate historian of the ancient world.

Yeah, really cool stuff.

Let's see.

There we go.

But we'll keep carrying on.

We'll go from verses 8 through 10.

So now at Lystra, again they've arrived, there was a man sitting who could not use his feet.

He was crippled from birth and had never walked.

He listened to Paul speaking.

And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well, said in a loud voice, stand upright on your feet.

And he sprang up and began walking.

So again, Paul and Barnabas, they've arrived in Lystra and are again preaching the gospel.

During the course of Paul's sermon, so a man is listening to what's being said, and he's also been paralyzed from birth.

And again, notice how listening or hearing is listed first.

This is so that we may know that it was the gospel that produced the faith the man had to be healed.

Because as Paul wrote in Romans, faith comes through hearing and hearing the word of God.

And so Paul is carefully watching this man as he's preaching.

And as he's watching, he first would see really the anxious face of a sinner as Paul's expounding and really giving the bad news first of he's a sinner.

And so the man will be thinking, how can I be safe under the wrath of God?

Is there an escape from this judgment?

But then as Paul is expounding the works of Christ, his death, and the place of sinners, the man's face would start to shift from one of shock and amazement to one of peace and comfort as the Holy Spirit is revealing the truths of Jesus Christ.

He's allowing the man to understand that Jesus himself is God made human, that who lived a sinless life, he died in our place and then took on the wrath of God.

And he rose from the dead, is now sitting at the right hand of God.

And either from Paul's discernment or a revelation of the Holy Spirit, he saw that this man had the faith to be healed.

And in Acts as well as the Gospels, faith is regularly emphasized as a condition of receiving both physical and spiritual healing.

That this lame man had faith was made clear that by the ready obedience to Paul's command.

Again, the strong association between belief and obedience.

So Paul says, rise up, and the man springs up and then begins to walk for the first time in his life.

And also back in Acts 3, we see God perform a similar miracle through Peter when he heals a lame man at the Jewish synagogue.

And Luke may have included this to show that, really to show that Paul's standing as an apostle.

Because at this time, there could have been still some many who doubted in the early church if Paul was at the same level as Peter.

And this is a good use to confirm it.

But also the main purpose was to highlight the wickedness of the crowd.

And so, we'll see that verses 11 through 13.

And so, this is an ugly display of paganism and idolatry that's going on.

But to the people's credit, there's a reason they're responding this way.

They believe a local myth is becoming reality before their very eyes.

Because according to the Roman poet Ovid, so there's a tradition in Lystra that the gods Zeus and Hermes would come down in disguises and then judge the people based on how well they treated them.

And tragically, at this point, it is about, I guess, 50 years before this event.

Zeus and Hermes, they visit Lystra, but no one helps them.

No one gives them food or water.

And then, however, there was one elderly couple named Philemon and Baucis.

They took in the gods, cared for them, even though they themselves were in poverty.

As a result, the gods, Zeus and Hermes, took Philemon and Baucis to safety, while then Zeus flooded and drowned the inhospitable people in Lystra.

They rewarded the couple by turning their poor cottage into a massive temple.

And then they served as a priest and priestess for the rest of their days.

And actually, when they died, they returned into stately trees.

So, as a pagan, I mean, it would sound pretty good that you see what Paul had just performed a miracle, that we don't want to miss this opportunity.

They're like, guys, come on, we could be massive oaks one day.

And this gives us insight into the local idolatries.

But everywhere, people all over the earth are following some kind of religion.

Atheism is a forced and trained approach.

People are generally spiritual, and they weave it into some kind of religion.

I mean, you can do a quick Google search, and you'll see the resurgence of the occult practices, like Wicca and everything.

And it's driven by younger generations.

They're seeking a religion, but it's growing away from traditional religious affiliation.

And now, if people are not worshiping the true God, they're going to be worshiping idols.

It's that simple.

Paul writes about this in Romans 1. 21 through 23.

For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking.

Their foolish hearts were darkened.

Claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal men and birds and animals and creeping things.

No one can say they don't worship anything, because if they do not worship and honor God, then they will be worshiping something else.

And now, Paul and Barnabas, as all this is going on, they're unaware what the people are doing.

They're unaware that the people are worshiping false gods because of a language barrier.

Because everything that's going on is happening in the local, like, Lycaonian dialect.

Either they figure it out, or someone tells them that these people are not, in fact, celebrating the glory of God, Paul's sermon, and, like, the miracle that's been happening.

But they're actually worshiping Paul and Barnabas, and then they're false gods through them.

We'll pick up in verse 14.

But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out, men, why are you doing these things?

We also are men of like nature with you, and we bring you good news that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.

In past generations, he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways, yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good.

By giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.

And once Paul and Barnabas, they realize what is happening, they're filled with horror, and they tear their garments, which is a Jewish way of showing intense grief.

It's often done in the presence of blasphemy.

And so this is clear evidence that Paul and Barnabas themselves have been captivated by the glory of God.

They have been rescued from their own idolatry, and they are now zealous for the glory of God.

I mean, so much so that when they bump into others who are still in darkness, who haven't been saved, who are still in sin, it brings them terrible grief.

I mean, Jesus himself wept over Jerusalem because of Jewish idolatry, the fact that they themselves did not recognize the true God.

And the question that we have to ask is, do we feel grief for unbelievers?

I mean, we are constantly surrounded by American idolatry and paganism.

We're surrounded by people who do not live for the glory of God.

As we see this, we don't have to necessarily tear our clothes, but our hearts torn.

I mean, do we have grief for loved ones, co-workers, moms at the park, or even strangers who do not know God?

And this grief, it's only temporary.

We will not have this grief in heaven.

And the grief that we feel isn't because of our sinful nature.

It's a conviction granted to us by the Holy Spirit so that we can look upon it as a gift of compassion, love, and a desire to want to see them reconciled to God.

This is what drives evangelism and missions is this grief.

And Paul preaches the same gospel to these people, but he tailors it for a pagan context.

And so he doesn't do what he does in the Jewish synagogues.

He doesn't go through the history of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

But he targets and expounds on the doctrines of creation and the doctrine of providence.

And this is instructive for us as we're living in an ever increasingly biblically illiterate society.

People may not know the Bible or really stories about the Bible, but they are constantly surrounded by the beautiful world that God made.

And so we start with the doctrine of creation.

And the doctrine of creation, it's essential to our evangelism.

It's not a sidebar or an optional topic that we can have, but it's essential.

And this is where we start with 21st century Americans.

And it's honestly even more clearly essential because of the constant push of trans and homosexual ideology today.

I mean, we live in a world where the phrase, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body, makes sense to the average person.

When probably not even about 30 years ago, it could be seen as a joke.

Because if all of creation is by chance, then why not just change it if we have the technology to do so?

I mean, what does it matter?

Like if we as humans have transcendent or above creation or have gotten past certain societal and natural boundaries, why not just do whatever we want?

And if you want a book that shows kind of what life looks like, if this line of thought is carried out, just read Ecclesiastes.

And what it says is it's vanity.

It's all vanity.

It's all meaningless if there is no God.

And when we want to evangelize those around us, we not only show how like the stars, the planets, the mountains, seas, animals, and humans are all created by God, but we also have to show that their conscience, their gender, their sexuality, their morality, all of that is created by God.

And we also see the humility of the apostles here.

They deny any special status compared to the Lycaonians.

So they exclaim that they're no better than them.

They're just bringing good news.

They're bringing the gospel.

Salvation through Jesus Christ, who is the savior of the world.

And then the command given by God is that these people should turn from their worthless idols because pagan idolatry is vanity.

Idolatry is emptiness.

It's completely worthless.

Their gods do not exist.

Their representations, their artistic creations are just chunks of stone and wood crafted by human imagination.

They're not true.

Even God says this in his own description of idols.

So Isaiah 46, one through four, bell bows down, nebo stoops.

These are Babylonian gods.

Their idols are on beast and livestock.

These things you carry are born as burdens on weary beasts.

They stoop, they bow down together.

They cannot save the burden, but themselves go into captivity.

Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel who have been born by me from before your birth, carried from the womb, even to your old age, I am he.

The I am he is another way of saying, like, I am who I am.

Like, God is calling himself Yahweh there.

And to gray hairs I will carry you.

I have made and I will bear.

I will carry and will save.

And this is the only true and living God.

These people have to carry their own gods whenever they wanted to move or if they're being led away into captivity.

They had to put them on animals or they have to carry them on their backs.

But then God makes it very clear that he is the one who bears our burdens and he carries us.

He's the one who makes, who gives life and is the one who saves.

God luckily also has amazing tolerance and patience because he has let all nations go their own way.

In other words, he didn't blot them out like Sodom and Gomorrah or like Noah's flood.

He could have, he had every right to, but he didn't.

But he also didn't send them prophets.

He didn't give them the very word of God like he did to the Jews.

He didn't get, they didn't get prophets and warnings to turn away from their idolatry.

God simply just let them go.

But he's also revealed himself in creation.

He wrote the truths of his existence and his basic moral structure on their hearts.

Romans 1, 19 through 20, for what can be known about God is plain to them because God has showed it to them.

For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world and the things that have been made.

So they are without excuse.

And then further on in Romans 2, Paul explains that they knew there was a creator God and that he has a moral standard.

And so what Paul is telling these Lycaonians is that their conscience was telling them that they were violating that moral standard, that they deserved to die for their idolatry and sin, but God allowed them to live.

Yet all that time, God did not leave himself without a witness.

And this is where we have to go.

The doctrine of providence.

And so Paul is saying the rising sun, the rains, every harvest of various fruits and vegetables and grains, all of these things show God's incredible kindness.

And then Jesus even says in the Sermon on the Mount that this, God giving everyone rains, giving them all harvest, is evidence that God loves his enemies.

And Paul is explaining that these people, that all of these good things are a display of God's kindness.

But now the time has come for the people to repent and to turn from their worthless idols.

Because before Christ, God allowed all the nations to go their own way.

And I just want to be very clear on this.

Go their own way means they were not saved.

That they died, that they will go to hell, but then now Christ has come and now God is commanding all of these people everywhere to repent of their idolatry.

And the gospel is a message to be believed, but it also precedes a command to be obeyed.

Again, belief and obedience go hand in hand.

Because we are messengers of this gospel.

We go in the name of the king issuing this command.

And that is our only role.

Again, we're not on the hook if people believe, if they're saved.

We just let them know what God has done and what he has commanded.

We're no different than those around us.

We're no better than them.

We get to share this message with everyone.

And then using Paul as an example, no one is outside the bounds of God's grace.

Because no one is too far gone.

Keep moving through 18 through 20.

So even with these words, they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.

But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.

But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city.

And on the next day, he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.

And it's really impossible to not see like the drama and the tension within Luke's account.

So then Paul and Barnabas, they finally get the crowd to settle down, to no longer offer idols or sacrifices to them.

But then suddenly Jews from Iconium and Antioch, they show up and they persuade the crowds to stone Paul.

But however, the enemies of the gospel did not kill Paul.

They only thought that they did.

Luke isn't claiming that what happened next was a resuscitation.

Paul didn't die and see the disciples were following those as they were dragging Paul out of the city.

They gathered around him to minister him, to help him, but then he suddenly gets up.

And this is a vivid illustration of what Paul will later write in 2 Corinthians 4.9, persecuted but not forsaken, struck down but not destroyed.

This also calls back to Paul's conversion story, where God tells Ananias in Acts 9.16 that I, this is God speaking, will show Paul how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.

Paul was not only resilient, but he was also courageous to return back to the city that just rejected them, that just stoned him, and then stay the night.

And the next morning he left for Derbe.

But the question must be asked, like, how could Paul's body bear the journey?

Because Derbe was a 40-mile trek to Lystra.

I mean, I couldn't imagine the damage to his head, his face, his body, arms and legs, because it was bad enough to make people think that he was dead.

I mean, just talk about the courage and sheerness of Paul.

He was determined to, as he continues with his mission.

And the one last thing to point out is the fickleness of the crowd in Lystra.

I mean, one day they're praising Paul and Barnabas, willing to offer sacrifices to them as if they were gods, and then soon after they join in stoning Paul as if he were a criminal.

And Luke recorded a similar account of the crowd in Jerusalem who praised Jesus but then demanded his crucifixion.

And like Jesus, Paul remains unmoved.

His character and his message were undeterred by both flattery and opposition.

We'll keep going through verses 21 and 22.

So we see the persistent proclamation of the gospel.

They preach the gospel and people are saved.

And then they return to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.

And this is also incredible courage because all of their enemies are still there.

But they knew, the disciples knew, that these new converts that they made in each of these cities needed to be sustained and strengthened in the faith.

They need to be built up in the faith.

Because proclaiming the gospel is the first step.

But once God saves someone, they must be built up in the faith to full maturity, teaching them to obey everything that Christ has commanded.

Because our faiths are assaulted every day by the world, the flesh, and the devil.

And so we must encourage each other to remain true to the faith.

And then the phrase the faith means doctrine.

And so every time we're together, we're always repeating the same doctrines that we've heard.

But then we encourage each other to hold fast to them, to stay true to what is being taught.

Paul also, he sets their expectation for suffering, saying that through many tribulations, we must enter the kingdom of God.

And it's very difficult to be a Christian.

I mean, we must expect opposition.

We must expect persecution.

And there are going to be many hard times ahead because I believe when it says the entering the kingdom of God, it means heaven.

So it's dying.

And you're going to die.

And if you die a Christian, you will have gone through a lot of suffering.

And suffering isn't just things from the outside attacking us, but it's also, again, as I call back to the grief we feel for unbelievers, that itself is suffering.

It's hard to have these values, these convictions, to see people fall short of what their original purpose is and not feel hurt and grief about it.

And this is what Paul is saying to these believers.

He's getting them ready.

And luckily he doesn't say just peace out and let them be, but he establishes the church government.

So I'll go through 23 to the end of the chapter.

So, and when they had appointed elders for them in every church with prayer and fasting, they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.

Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.

And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Italia.

And from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled.

And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them.

And now he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles and they remained no little time with the disciples.

And so Paul and Barnabas, they're visitors who are about to leave.

And so they need to leave behind leaders who are going to do the pastoring, the shepherding, the preaching, and the teaching.

And so in every church they appoint elders.

And so it's plural.

And so the pattern of a plurality of elders is not only taught here, but also established in many parts of the New Testament.

And so again, this is why we have multiple elders here, because it is clearly biblical.

And I also love the picture of Paul commending both the elders and the church to the Lord, because he's showing how God himself is the ultimate authority, but also giving the church and letting them rest in God's protection amidst being surrounded by opposition and hostility.

And so then they finally return to Syrian Antioch, and they felt accountable to give them a report of all that God had done through them.

And so this report must have been very vital to the Antioch church.

I mean, how exciting it was for them to hear what God was doing, like hundreds of miles away.

And then within the report, the emphasis is on God's work.

It's on God's miracles, and it's on God's saving grace.

They just simply say, we are only instruments in God's loving and gracious act of opening the door of faith to the Gentiles.

And when we get to heaven on Judgment Day, we'll be going before God and saying, for every good work I ever did, God did it.

Paul says this in Romans 15, 18 through 19, for I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, to bring the Gentiles to obedience by word or by deed, by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Spirit of God.

And so what God is doing in Acts 14 is helping us see what kind of people we need to be, and how committed we need to be to the mission of being his witnesses to the end of the earth.

So the question, kind of to wrap this up, is what do we need to be faithful in spreading the gospel?

And so we need to first off stay focused on the message of the gospel.

We need to understand the message and proclaim it boldly.

And we can only understand this message if we are reading scripture regularly.

Because again, as Christians, we can easily still be idolaters.

Because if we're not in the scriptures, then we'll be proclaiming a message or worship a God that we think is right.

I forget who said this, I heard someone say that God created man in his own image, and then man has returned the favor.

And so we must not create a God who's more benevolent and gracious to us, but then more judgmental and wrathful to others.

Only God can reveal and tell us who he is, and this is which is why we must be in scripture.

And really just like an easy way to do this, I would encourage you all to try to memorize maybe like a verse a day, every other day, every couple of days.

I mean, if we can memorize lyrics to countless songs, I believe we have the ability to memorize at least one verse every day or every couple days.

But to put this in perspective, if you memorize, say, a verse a day, you'll be able to memorize the whole book of Philippians in about just over three months, and even the book of Ephesians in just over five.

And again, just memorizing a few verses, it's a wonderful way to be immersed in scripture all day.

Because even like trying this out as well, like as I'm, I don't know, sitting at a traffic light or taking a break from work, it's just nice to like go through the verses in my head, and also helps fight anxiety or anything that's going on, because you are constantly being focused on God's word.

And then secondly, we need to understand and study the vain thoughts and idolatries of the people that we're trying to reach, as well as our own thoughts and idolatries, so that we can then combat them with biblical truth.

And this is why understanding the gospel and memorizing scripture is so important, because we must put it to use.

Because if we believe this message is the word of God, if we believe, as Jesus says in his high priestly prayer in John 17, that God's word is truth, that it's not some sort of, it's not meeting some sort of like external standard, but his word is the standard by which everything else is compared and tested, then this is what we need to use to combat sinful thoughts and idolatries.

Because our culture is confused, because there's no longer any standard.

Our culture is very deeply individualistic, goodness, justice, and even truth is defined by each person.

I mean, it's madness.

It's foolishness and it leads to utter hopelessness.

And I hope, I mean, there's a twinge, again, of grief kind of in your soul as I'm saying these things, so that like Jesus, we can have compassion on a crowd who is without a shepherd.

Realizing this kind of hopes gives you the desire to want people around you to be saved.

Now, I'm not saying go to a street corner and start letting them have it or anything like that.

What I want to do, I want to suggest is to start asking people why.

Kind of start slowly having them unpack and reveal their beliefs and motivations about certain things.

I mean, there's plenty of times people are sharing their thoughts on current events, different TV shows, movies that they like, or really kind of just giving an unsolicited opinion.

And it's a perfect time to ask why.

Have them explain more about what they're thinking and then what they believe about certain solutions.

Why do they think that thing is right and this thing is wrong?

And also, this is why we prepare to know our message because we will most likely be asked why back.

And I assume, or hopefully, everyone's come to a realization and had an event where they hear a hard question about their faith and they're like, "Holy cow, I don't know how I could defend that. I don't know how I could say why I believe what I believe."

Again, knowing scripture and the doctrines taught in them is pretty powerful.

It provides stable support that is needed to not only combat other people's arguments, but it also helps to help put to death the sinful nature within our own hearts.

Then we also must realize that our time is brief and is meant to be in service for this mission of spreading the gospel.

And again, it's not just evangelizing, but it's establishing and helping others to establish healthy churches that have sound doctrine and a plurality of elders.

And then lastly, we must realize all of this is going to be hard.

We will suffer.

We're going to be met with opposition.

We'll be met with hostility.

Again, asking people to share their thoughts and then kind of showing them that they're wrong will not always have good outcomes.

Just take a look basically throughout this whole chapter we just went through.

But we can take comfort that we have been committed to the Lord, that He holds us, that He saves us, that He protects us, that He sustains us, and He uses us to proclaim and show His glory.

Let's pray.

God, we thank You so much for just who You are.

Just Your pure existence is, I mean, all that You need.

I mean, You need nothing from us.

You need nothing from anyone else.

You alone are self-existent and all-powerful.

Thank You for revealing Your attributes, not only in nature, but especially revealing Yourself through Scripture.

Giving us this time to study it, to hear from You, to put down our own idols, to see them as worthless, and be able to turn to You, who is the loving and amazing God.

Allow us to start to understand this message in a better way, in a more true way, based on Your Scripture, and allow that to convict us and see others and how they have fallen short of Your glory, not knowing that You know that we're better than them, but to see and feel grief for who You've created them to be and how they've fallen short of that.

Allow us to have the courage and ask them why, to unpack their motivations and show them what Your standard is, how they've fallen under that, but then also how You've given Your Son, how You've allowed Him to be our righteousness, how He's taken our place, and how He can take their place as well.

Again, just allow us to keep continuing to encourage each other.

This is going to be hard.

Luckily, we have certain, I guess, government laws in place, but we cannot depend on any of those to keep us safe, but we can always depend on You to keep us safe, to sustain us, and to grow Your church.

We love You so very much.

In Christ's name we pray.

Amen.
