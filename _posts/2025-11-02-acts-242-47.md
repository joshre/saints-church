## Transcription

Okay, good morning.

Okay, we can turn in our Bibles to Acts chapter 2, verse 42-47.

And as you’re turning there, I’m going to catch you up.\n We keep coos.\n It was so sweet last week, baby Henry.

And the end of our time when I was like, oh, let’s call for silence, and then baby Henry starts cooing, and it was like the sweetest thing.\n It was like just a reminder of how our plans are so not important compared to the Lord's.\n how... how faithful he is.

At least for me.

That’s how I took it, so.

And it was sweet.

Jessica was like, sorry.

And I was like, no.

Are you kidding me?

Like, you think I expect a baby to listen to me?.\n Sorry, I got caught up there.

I guess not.

Okay, so we’ve taken the last few weeks to slow... to, like, kind of slow start our journey into the book of Acts, and then actually after this week, we’re going to try our best to do, like, a chapter a week.

Usually we go slowly, verse by verse, and then I just...

I kind of wanted to hit the accelerator and just kind of a little speed up a little bit.

So, after this, when we start Acts chapter 3, because these are the final verses of Acts chapter 2, Acts chapter 3, we’re going to try to go a week, a chapter a week, and that should be super fun.

But let me recap us, in case you’ve forgotten, through these two chapters of Acts.

So, Acts, of course, starts.

If you turn your Bible a page or two, if you’ve got a paper one, you’ll see Acts starts.

We see Jesus in his final days.

We see after his resurrection and before his ascension into heaven.

And he tells the disciples, the disciples to go and wait in Jerusalem, and the Spirit will come upon them, and they will be his witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

So then he tells them that, and then Jesus ascends into heaven, where he is now.

And so the apostles, disciples, they obey Jesus' commands, and they head into Jerusalem.

And it was the ten days later, on the day of Pentecost, Pentecost, Pente, Pentagon.

It's got five points.

Pentecost, 50 days.

Anyways.

After the Passover, and everybody was back in town for festival, because that was the status quo.

Everyone went to Jerusalem for the festival.

And so we have Jews from all over the sort of world at the time, all came back together.

And Jesus' people are gathered, and then they start speaking in different languages of the people who were there.

And then Peter stands up and preaches, and he calls the people to repentance and baptism.

And 3,000 are added to their number that day.

And that's kind of where we find ourselves this morning.

And Acts chapter 2, verses 42 through 47 is the aftermath of this miraculous event.

We get to see what the early church was about, what they were made of, what was important to them, and what was so noteworthy of the writer of the book of Acts, Luke.

Luke, Acts, they're kind of together.

Part one is Luke's account, his gospel account.

And then Acts is his second book.

And what is so noteworthy that the Spirit made sure it was added to these scriptures.

So, let's read Acts 2, verses 42 through 47.

If somebody wants to read that aloud, you can go for it.

Acts 2, verses 42 through 47.

We're reading out of the ESV, ESV.

Acts 2, verses 42 through 47.

Somebody just pick it up and go.

Acts 2, verses 42 through 48.

So, this is a summary passage, right?

This isn't all that the early church did, but it gives us incredible insights into what mattered to Luke and these early believers.

As we've been teaching in Acts, I've been talking about this idea between descriptive and prescriptive.

As we look at the book of Acts, because it is a historical account, we need to kind of ask ourselves and ask the question, Is this passage descriptive?

Is this passage descriptive?

Is it describing what the early church did?

Or is it prescriptive?

Is it a prescription for us as believers to take, to do, right?

Like Acts 1, verse 8, where Jesus says, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

That is a prescription.

That is something that all believers should do and should be doing.

And as we look at this text of Acts 2, verses 42 through 47, where we get a summary of the early church, we need to ask ourselves that question.

Is this passage descriptive or is it prescriptive?

And I would say it's descriptive, but I would also say it would be foolish of us to just leave it at that.

It would be foolish of us to just leave it as descriptive.

I'm reminded of C.

S.

Lewis puts it in his book, The Screwtape Letters, as intellectual snobbery to kind of look back at these early church members and think just because we've progressed as a society in intellect and in technology that we're smarter, more thoughtful, and more enlightened than our early church brothers and sisters.

And I reject that frame of thinking.

And I would say these guys and gals walked with Jesus, talked with Jesus, and so my guess would be that they would have a better idea of what he wanted and desired for his people.

It's kind of like the game of telephone.

We've all played that game before where somebody starts and they might have a phrase or a sentence and then it gets passed around the circle.

And by the time you get to the end of it, where it started and where it ended, two different places, right?

And thank the Lord for the scriptures that are truth that we can be grounded in and go back to, or else us as Christians, all these thousands of years later, we would be up a creek without a paddle.

But we have the scriptures to anchor us, to remind us of truth.

And so the question and kind of my thought process through this message is to go back.

What is the mission of the church?

What did the church do?

How did they act?

How were they looking out for each other then?

And how does that apply to us congregationally as a church, but also individually?

So let's begin.

Acts 2, 42.

And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and the prayers.

So we see that the early church devoted themselves to these four things right off the bat.

We see the apostles' teaching, right?

They devoted themselves to the teachings from the apostles.

Those, and with context clues, we could assume that those were the things that Jesus taught, the things Jesus told them after his resurrection.

And Old Testament scriptures taught in light of the revelation of Jesus.

Why can't I assume those things?

Well, first we can look at Peter's sermon.

What does he do?

He takes those Old Testament passages and he preaches them in light of Jesus Christ.

Then the gospels all recount what Jesus said and did.

And my guess would be that the gospel writers did not just keep their mouth shut until they actually wrote it down with pen and paper, but that they were telling the stories of what Jesus did.

And so already we see a church that was reminding themselves of what Jesus said and what Jesus did.

Then lastly, we get this clue on the road to Emmaus in Luke chapter, I believe it's 25.

Jesus is teaching the disciples in light of Old Testament.

So again, we see this reinforcement of the Old Testament.

Jesus is teaching the disciples how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecy.

So the apostles' teachings, when we see that, we can kind of context clues.

Those are the things that they taught then.

Then we see this word fellowship, which is the Greek word koinonia, which the most general sense of this term refers to a shared conviction that manifests itself or shows itself as mutual responsibility and status.

So most often koinonia refers to the sharing of resources that would be monetary and otherwise, which we get a glimpse of in the verses to follow, right?

And I think for us, when we think of the word fellowship, like we might think of just like we're hanging out and like talking with one another, right?

Like fellowship.

Oh, we just had a lovely time of fellowship this morning.

It's kind of one of those Christianese words.

But it was this powerful thing of a community coming together.

And we're going to look at that a little later.

Then we get the breaking of bread.

Some scholars argue that this phrase is exclusive for the Lord's Supper.

Others argue that it means like regular, like ordinary meals as well as the Lord's Supper.

I'm in that camp.

I want to be part of a church that likes to eat together.

Hello.

That likes to have some good vibes and good food.

You know what I'm saying?

And of course, not neglecting the ordinance of the Lord's Supper.

Our Lord commanded us to partake of these elements in remembrance of Him.

And He is present with us in those moments.

And that's what we see happen in the early church.

As well as prayers.

Notice it's plural.

It's not just they devote themselves to prayer.

But prayers.

And so for them, that could be the traditional Jewish prayers that were regularly recited.

As well as some new prayers that the apostles taught.

My guess would be, wild guess would be, the prayer that the apostles taught would probably be the Lord's Prayer.

That would be just a random guess.

No education needed for that one, really.

Those are the four pillars of the early church.

They devote themselves to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayers.

Simple.

Simple.

Verse 43.

And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles.

We could see through the life of Jesus that miracles validated His message.

And now here are Jesus' apostles.

And let me remind us that apostle means sent ones.

And these are Jesus' disciples whom He chose, who walked with Him in ministry, and who He sent out to lead His church.

Okay, so we get this idea that Jesus' miracles validated His message.

Let me take you back to John chapter 3 when He's talking with Nicodemus.

And what is the conversation that Nicodemus says?

Nicodemus is saying, like, hey, we see the signs and wonders.

We know, like, there's something happening here.

They validated His message.

And Jesus taught of that multiple times.

We can look at Mark.

We can look at John.

They both bring this up, how the signs, like, indicate.

There were even times in confrontations with the Pharisees where they're like, who do you say you are?

And Jesus is like, check out the signs.

Check out the wonders.

Check out the miracles.

Jesus did miracles to validate His message of being the Messiah.

And here we see the apostles did miracles to affirm or to validate the message given to them by Jesus Christ.

And the text calls them wonders and signs.

Right?

They are a sign.

They are not the point.

They are a sign.

And some today make miracles the point.

They want to get so over-focused on the miracle that they miss the miracle maker.

Sometimes we can get so focused on the healing that we miss the healer.

They are signs, not the point.

The miracles were a sign that the message the apostles were bringing was from God.

A sign to the power and authority given to the apostles by Jesus Christ.

And so what did the apostles do?

They pointed the people to Jesus.

You might be asking me, so, Nate, do you believe in miracles?

Of course I do.

I've mentioned this.

I already kind of mentioned this earlier.

But the fact that, like, Jesus, part of the Godhead, came to earth as a baby.

Have you really, like, sat and thought about that?

Like, we get...

I love a nativity.

Okay, truthfully, I don't really love a nativity.

But I see it.

I understand it.

But we have this nativity scene, and we see just little baby Jesus, six-pound, eight-ounce baby Jesus, wrapped in swaddling clothes.

Like, we get...

We just kind of, like, brush that off.

Like, oh, that's cute.

Jesus came.

I mean, but no, God became a baby.

That is a miracle.

But not only that.

That baby then grew into a man.

That baby, that toddler, that child, lived a perfect life.

Perfection for Jesus did not start at age 30 when he was baptized.

Some of us parents of young kids are like, Wow.

Could you imagine that?

I put him down for bed, and they listen?

He lived a perfect life.

Then he died, and then he was buried, and then he rose from the grave on the third day, and then he ascended into heaven.

That's a miracle.

And then 40 days later, well, 50 days later, 40 days he ascended into heaven. 40 days he was on earth after his resurrection.

And then, the Spirit comes, just like he said it would happen.

And now, somehow, all of his righteousness is accounted to me?

All of that counts for me?

That is the greatest miracle of all time.

In fact, the only miracle that I need.

So, do I pray for healing?

Do I pray for miracles of reconciliation of people and other earthly needs?

Of course I do.

Whether God chooses to intervene in a supernatural way or not is not my call.

But I bring everything that I have, everything that I am, to him. because he tells me to, because the scriptures show us how that's done.

Regardless of the outcome.

So, a question I have for us is, are you in awe of the miracle of salvation in you?

Does that blow you away?

If not, I need you to take a good look in the mirror.

You do not deserve salvation.

And yet, you have it through no work of your own.

It is a free gift given to you by Jesus.

He said, I choose you.

Here you go.

My righteousness can count towards your unrighteousness.

Are you in awe of that miracle?

Verse 44 tells us, And all who believed were together and had all things in common.

All who believed, believed what?

Believed that Jesus was in fact the Messiah.

All who believed were together, like in one physical location.

Probably not one physical location, not many houses, could fit 3,000 people at a time.

But this altogether more so describes the unity of the believers as we will continue to see throughout these next few verses.

All who believed were together and had all things in common, and had all things in common.

What does this mean?

It most likely means that if another believer needed something or lacked something, then another believer would step up and help.

It most likely means that if another believer needed something or lacked something, then another believer would step up and help.

Which leads us to verse 45.

And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all as any had need.

So, we have this body of believers whose priority was the body of believers.

This is not some like socialist agenda where they were forced to give up their land and property and possessions. it was voluntary.

And it was to provide for fellow believers within the community.

It could also look like opening your home for the church to gather.

Right?

We have this group of 3,000 and maybe you were one who came from a far off and distant land to come to the festival at Pentecost and you're saved by the Lord and you're wrapped up in this community and you're like, I don't want to go back yet.

Hey, you got a couch I could crash on?

Hey, you have some food to eat?

All my work is back at home.

They were helping each other.

They were opening doors and homes and gathering and oh man I've got this calf or I've got this goat like let's feast let's have a good time.

It was this deep sense of fellowship where there is a sharing and people are using what God has given them to share with everyone else.

Honestly, it reminds me of a time last year for us as a church when we were low on funds and I called the heads of houses of members of our church and said hey, the church is short on money through the end of the year I'm asking you to prayerfully see what you can give to help out and sure enough we made it through because a lot of people and families stepped up.

What's the point here?

What's the point here?

Let me see if I can write this half decently.

Radical generosity.

That didn't look half bad.

In the Old Testament we see the tithe get instituted which tithe literally means a tenth a ten percentage of your income went to the church and to the temple which is a wonderful principle.

And if you don't like the tithe you're not really going to like the early church because they were giving way more than a tenth.

And I'm not here to tell you exactly what you should give but I'm saying you should give.

And I believe as a church as a body of believers we should be doing the same.

That's why we give to local ministries.

That's why we have missionaries that we partner with and help support to help the body of Christ around the world because we've been called to this idea of radical generosity.

The things that I have in fact are not my own they have been given to me by the Lord and I will look for ways to help not just with dollars and cents but with the other things that I have been given the gifts, talents, abilities the homes, property like the things that I have everything that I have the businesses the things that I do everything can be used for my new family.

Radical generosity. 46 tells us in day by day attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes they receive their food with glad and generous hearts praising God and having favor with all the people day by day think about that for a second day by day you think coming to church just on Sundays is hard?

A group that meets once a month or every other week a prayer gathering that's once a month that's just a lot that's just a lot we got so much going on and it's hard to find a sitter sometimes I've got this that and the other I'm not here to poke fun or condemn but are we making excuses or making time?

Are we making excuses or are we making time? the early church made the time day by day attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes some cynics think that the early church thought that Jesus was coming back like very quickly so it was easy to sell property and possessions because oh yeah he's going to be back in a couple weeks we'd be good like who needs this home? who needs this property? like Jesus is coming back soon it could almost it was almost this like carefree pseudo-hippie movement without the free love and the drugs right? like that's sometimes what cynics kind of paint this picture as which there might be some truth to that but at least they put their money where their mouth was and even if that is the case it worked out in their favor when the church scattered from Jerusalem God freed them up and day by day attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes they received their food with glad and generous hearts with glad and generous hearts attitude check this was for me this I'll let you inside when I'm preparing a message and I'm going through the last part of the message is I go through it and I pray through the message and like I'm just asking God like where where is this for me like and I'm I want God to just like I want God to wreck me truthfully and this was the thing for me glad and generous hearts man how's my attitude when I step into into church when I step into a place like this when I when I step into a group scenario or I'm serving outside of the church like what's my attitude what's my attitude in my even my time at home in family worship or family church like and I'm not saying you can't have a down day or be sad sometimes but is gratitude filling your heart if not where is your focus where is your focus so as a part of family church for our church or through for my family throughout the week we've started reciting some scriptures with the kids and so one of the scriptures we say is today is the day that the Lord has made I will rejoice and be glad in it and it's crazy we don't again we don't we don't make it every morning or every day sometimes we miss but every morning that we do that I feel something in me change I feel my attitude change and get refocused that today is the day that the Lord has made so I will rejoice and be glad in it when my kids are going through something hard I want that I want that to be the thing that they remind themselves of when Kayla is going through something hard I want that to be the scripture that she reminds herself of that's the that's the ongoing soundtrack in our home that today is the day that the Lord has made so I will rejoice and be glad in it where is your focus my focus does not have to be on the world but on God and the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved the result of early of the early believers living on mission was the Lord adding to their number see the Lord adds the Lord adds so as we start our descent what were the priorities of the early believers what were the priorities of the early believers and notice I changed the wording there because it can be easy for us to hear the word early church and think of this collective which yes they were and we are even part of the church we think of this collective and just think of this group of first three thousand that were saved but each of them made these choices that we learned about today it was individual people who were on mission together so yes they are the early church but they are individual believers that devoted themselves to the apostles teaching it was the early believers individual believers that devoted themselves to fellowship it was the early believers that devoted themselves to the breaking of bread and to prayers and so the question is are these a priority in your life we can model these things as a church this passage Acts 2 42 through 47 is like the foundational passage of our church the mission vision of why we organize and do things the way that we do but if we are not living these things out individually then we are missing the mark then you are missing the mark so where does the reality of the early church and your reality differ as we look at this passage and think of it in our own context it is a song and dance of both the corporate and the individual and as a church we need to be guided by the spirit and the scriptures and individually you must do the same to be led by the spirit is to be led by the scriptures because the spirit will never contradict the book he wrote so when we look at the early church we see individuals powered by the spirit being faithful witnesses of Jesus in their everyday lives listen listen how we live and how we act and treat people outside of this building matters some people might never step into our church but they interact with you as we read and saw the early church they found favor with all the people are you finding favor with the people in your life if not you don't look at them look at you and this isn't to people please it's asking the question what are others witnessing of me you see we can value these things as a church body but if we do not live them out then what's the point so are you devoted to the apostles teaching are you in the scriptures another question asked there is what are you teaching through the way you live are you in fellowship are you creating time and space for your church the people in your church in your life breaking of bread are you inviting others into your home and the prayers what is your prayer life do you have a prayer life are you praying regularly and often do you have patterns and rhythms and habits of prayer throughout your day throughout your life this message is might be a little difficult to hear because there is so much that is just right in your face are you doing this are you doing that and again this is not like to earn salvation we know that Christ earned salvation for us and that it's a free gift and there's nothing attached to that gift but if we are saved then and the spirit is within us then he will sanctify us he will change us so I'm asking you the question are you being changed if not it's maybe time to look inward and ask the Lord to help you would you pray with me Lord help us to be people who devote ourselves to the word not just on Sundays but throughout the week help us to be people who care for each other and are there for each other help us to invite each other and our neighbors into our homes and would you ignite a fire in us to be people of prayer you said yourself Jesus that your house is to be a house of prayer so please let us be faithful in that in Jesus name everyone said amen and amen as we close before we're dismissed just a few things I want to bring to mind we have our prayer gathering this Wednesday 7pm right here in this room and over the next few prayer gatherings we're actually going to be praying through the names of God and just kind of pin picking some names of God and the scriptures attached and so this Wednesday our theme is the God who sees the God who sees I'm looking forward to that one then next week like I said at the beginning we'll start in Acts chapter 3 and a chapter a week and actually Evan is preaching so don't miss that one it's going to be awesome and then November 19th I'm going I'm inviting you to Friendsgiving at the Reader Esparza's and we'll send a sign up for going out for food but that'll be Wednesday November 19th 7pm at the Reader Esparza's we did that last year and it was a grand old time so we'll see ourselves doing that again this year so put that in your calendars and have a great week and we'll see you Wednesday peace peace
