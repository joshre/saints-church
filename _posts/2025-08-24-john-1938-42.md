## Transcription

So, over the past few weeks we've been looking at the trial, of course, the crucifixion of Jesus, and this week we are continuing down this storyline and we're just focusing in on the burial of Jesus.

And the Apostles' Creed, it has this line, Jesus suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.

He descended into hell.

So, we've covered the suffered, we've covered the crucified, and Jesus surely did die, and this morning we're going to look at the buried, and he descended into hell.

So, let's jump right back into the text.

Verse 38 says, After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might be taken away, might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission.

So, he came and took away his body.

If we look at the other Gospel accounts, we will see that Joseph was, in fact, a member of the Sanhedrin.

So, just for your memory, there is the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Sanhedrin.

And so, he was one of the Jewish elites, one of the Jewish sort of ruling class of the time, if you will.

And he was rich.

Joseph of Arimathea was rich.

And this is just taken from all the other Gospel accounts.

He was rich.

He was looking for the Kingdom of God.

And here, in John, specifically, we see he is a disciple of Jesus.

Right?

It says that right there.

Who was a disciple of Jesus.

And so, and he secretly feared the Jews.

Now, why he feared the Jews, it doesn't give us the exact reasoning as why.

But, we could just kind of plainly see, you are a member of the religious elite.

You're a member of the ruling class of the Jews.

And you are a disciple of Jesus.

That kind of goes against your day job.

So, I'm sure there was some fear there.

And there was some, probably a pretty hard spot that he's in.

But anyways, he uses his status, he uses his status of being in the Sanhedrin to get to Pilate and requests the body of Jesus.

And so, under Roman law, the bodies of executed criminals were normally handed over to their next of kin.

But not so in the case of those crucified for sedition, which Jesus was.

And so, they were left to the vultures.

And this was the ultimate sign of shame and humiliation.

So, they would be left out on the cross.

And the vultures and other birds of the time would come and just sort of pick at their bodies.

That's pretty gross, right?

As a sign of shame and humiliation.

Like, this person isn't even worth going in the grave.

So, Joe, as I call him, gets Jesus' body.

And then John tells us in verse 39 that Nicodemus, also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about 75 pounds in weight.

So, they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.

Nicodemus, if you remember, it's one of my favorite stories in the book of John.

It's all the way back in John chapter 3.

He gets a mention of John now after the, a mention in John after the death of Jesus.

And John notes that Nicodemus came to Jesus in the night.

Okay, so let's sing about this for a moment.

So, Nicodemus came to Jesus all the way back in John chapter 3 in the night, right?

And now, here is John mentioning him again, but in the light.

He's in the light.

So, Nicodemus at first, all the way back in John chapter 3, came to Jesus in darkness, in the dead of the night.

And now, John mentions him.

He says, earlier who had come to Jesus by night.

And again, we know that there was a rush to get Jesus off, all these criminals, off of the cross for Passover.

And so, it is still in the light of the day that Nicodemus is coming to Jesus now.

First, he came to him in night, and now he's coming to him in the light.

And these are the words of Jesus back in John chapter 3 in his conversation with Nicodemus.

John 3.

And this is the judgment.

The light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their works were evil.

For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.

But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out by God.

So, here is John making this sort of note.

First time, again, he mentions him.

It's dark.

Potentially, John is mentioning that Jesus came to the night.

And now here is Nicodemus coming to the light, so that his works should be exposed, if we were to take the words from John back in John chapter 3.

And what does he bring?

He brings 75 pounds in weight.

One of the other gospels, or sorry, the NIV interprets this.

They get the exact measurement, which is actually like 64 and a half pounds.

Either way, that's a lot of spices.

That is a lot of spices.

And the purpose of the spices is to drown out the smell of the decaying body.

The Egyptians would embalm dead bodies, which we're not going to go into that whole process, because it's worse than the vultures picking up bodies.

Unless you want me to go into the detail of embalming.

Okay.

Okay.

Kylie's like, yeah.

Ah, what the heck.

So what they would do is, they would take the innards out from the bodies, and then stuff it with the spices.

That was what the Egyptians would do.

That was part of the mummifying process.

And then they would, so they would take the spices, put them in the bodies, and then they would wrap them in the, in, that's what, so pretty gross.

Anyways, that's not what the Jews did.

The Jews, they just used the spices to help with the smell.

So, if you can remember back to Lazarus, in my paraphrase, they don't say this, but they say, in my paraphrase of Lazarus, they say, don't open up the grave, because he gonna stank.

Right?

Or quoting the King James Version, it says, he stinketh.

Right?

And so, verse 40, verse 41, now, in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden, a new tomb, in which no one had yet been laid.

So because of the Jewish day of preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.

So, John is the only gospel account that tells us about this tomb being a new tomb, and that no one had ever been laid in it.

Most likely, and I won't spoil too much here, which, I mean, I guess we all know Jesus gets raised again.

Anyways, most likely, John puts this in chapter 19, which again, there were no chapters and verses when John was writing this, but for our sake, he puts this detail in the text, probably because in chapter 20, he mentions that there was an empty tomb, and that nobody was in the tomb, and that nobody had been in there.

So, the only person who could have been resurrected, the only person who could have been in there, was Jesus.

That's probably why John gives us this detail, so when the payoff happens in chapter 20, that there's no confusion around tombs, because what was sort of customary back in Jewish times was that there would be sort of a family tomb, that, you know, a family member would die in this tomb, there would be this bone box that they would keep the bones in, and then whoever in the family was dead next, they would use that same tomb, because tombs were expensive.

This was kind of an expensive thing.

They were actually pretty elaborate, too, the tombs were.

It wasn't just like, you know, us now, we think of the people digging out, burying six feet under, and then covering with the dirt.

No, these would have been at least legitimate tombs.

They would have been carved out, and there would have been different sort of spaces within the cave.

So, traditionally, there was about five fingers, if you will, not actual fingers, but five different spaces and places within the tomb where these bodies would go.

And so, John is mentioning in 19 that this was a brand new tomb.

No one ever would have been in that tomb.

And so then in chapter 20, when they see the tomb is empty, oh, then that must have been Jesus.

But this morning, the question I want to ask and answer today is, what happened with Jesus while he was dead?

What happened with Jesus while he was dead?

And as we answer this question, it's very nuanced, and I actually don't know for certain what the exact answer is, but it's a question worth talking about and a question worth pondering.

And so, we're actually going to break it down into parts.

The first being, what happened with Jesus while he was dead?

We're going to look at his physical body, what happened with his physical body, what happened with his soul or his spirit, and then lastly, the phrase from the Apostles' Creed on his descent into hell.

So, what happened with his physical body?

As we read in our text this morning, Jesus truly died and was buried.

We just read it.

We just went over it.

His physical body, he truly died, and he was embalmed with 75 pounds of myrrh, a mixture of myrrh and aloes.

How usually that would happen is they would place some of the herbs, the myrrh, all in aloes.

They would place some of them on the actual place where they were buried, which was usually some sort of like table or raised sort of station.

Then, it would go a mixture of the myrrh and aloes.

Then, the body would go on top of those, and the body was wrapped in a shroud or in pieces of linen or cloth, or it could be one, it could be multiple.

Anyways, then the body, then that covers on the top, and then more of the myrrh aloes.

And so, what do we see that happen with his physical body?

He actually died, and he was actually buried.

That one's pretty easy.

What about Jesus' soul or his spirit?

If we look at Luke 22, 46, it says, Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, this is while he's still on the cross, said, Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.

And having said this, he breathed his last.

So, from these words here, we could believe or say that Jesus was with the Father.

Into your hands I commit my spirit.

So, Jesus died, and when he died, he went to heaven.

Another point on that is just a few verses earlier, in Luke 22, 43, and this is Jesus to the thief on the cross.

He says, And he said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you will be with me in paradise.

Jesus says, Today you will be with me in paradise.

So, that's, if he's saying today, he probably means that same day.

They're both dying.

So, today you will be with me in paradise.

So, what happened with Jesus, with his soul, spirit, when he died?

Jesus went to be with the Father after his death.

Jesus went to heaven after his death.

Okay, so what about this descent into hell?

The descent into hell could be understood as God's wrath on the cross was hell for Jesus.

It could be understood as Jesus' agony of God's wrath on the cross.

Like, Jesus experienced hell on the cross.

Not a literal descent to hell.

And some scriptures for this, you see here is Isaiah 53, 10, where it says, Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him.

And again, that's the psalm that talks about the suffering servant.

And so, literally, Jesus on the cross, it was the will of the Lord to crush him.

And Jesus, quote, Psalm 22, 1 from the cross, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

The hell that Jesus experienced was the separation from God, was the wrath of God on the cross.

Another interpretation could be a literal descent, but not for suffering, but as a victory march over hell and Satan.

So, a literal descent, not for suffering, but for a victory march over hell and Satan. 1 Peter 3, 18-19 says, In which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison.

That's Peter saying that Jesus went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, were in prison, to hell.

So, that is two sort of interpretations of this descent into hell.

So, we don't know for certain what exactly happened on this descent into hell, why it's in the Apostles' Creed, and should that make us worried?

Should that bring doubt to our faith?

No.

Why?

Because what do we know?

Jesus died a real death.

He was buried, but He did not stay in the grave.

So, what happened exactly on this, with Jesus during these days while He was dead?

We cannot say exactly for certain, but that's a comma.

He did not stay dead.

He rose from the grave.

So, whatever happened in that time, it was, it wasn't good enough.

Why?

Because He did not need to stay dead.

He came out of the grave.

So, regardless of what happened with Jesus on this descent into hell, what do we know?

Jesus died a real death.

He was buried, but He did not stay in the grave.

And so, this morning, as we look at Jesus' death and His burial, we look at what happened with His physical body, we look at what happened with His spirit, and we look at this descent into hell.

What do we do about it?

What's, what's, what do we do about it?

I want us to remember that Jesus suffered for us.

Jesus suffered for us.

And so, what do we need to do?

We need to thank Him for our salvation.

We need to thank Him for going to the cross, for taking the wrath that was due to us and putting it upon Himself.

I heard a story this, this, this week of someone explaining the gospel.

An illustration of how to explain the gospel.

And he told the story as if he said there was, there was a king.

And this king, he put out a decree because people were stealing things and taking things and he said, okay, from this point forward, if anyone takes, if anyone steals or takes anything, their punishment is death.

If anyone takes anything, if anyone steals anything from me again, if anyone steals anything from the kingdom again, the penalty, the punishment is death.

And so, he makes this decree and someone keeps on stealing.

Someone keeps on taking.

And then they finally catch who that person is.

And that person is his daughter.

The king's daughter is taken, is stealing.

And so, this king who is just, this king who wants to do what he says, what does he do?

Does he change the rules for his family?

Does he change the rules for his daughter?

Well, they ask.

And he says, no, she must be put to death.

And that death was enough lashes to kill.

So, the king is standing there and his daughter is at the execution table.

And before the executioner takes the whip and starts lashing, he says, wait!

The king goes down to the execution table and stands over her and stands in her place and says, okay, now you can go. this is a picture of the gospel.

It is a picture of someone taking what we owe and standing over us and taking the whipping, taking the beating for us.

That is the gospel.

That is our salvation.

I'm getting ahead of myself here.

But John 20, chapter 17 tells us, Jesus said to her, do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father.

But go to my brothers and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.

God.

If we look throughout the gospels, Jesus is always referring to the Father as his Father.

And now what does he say here in John chapter 20 after his resurrection?

He says to my Father and your Father.

To my God and your God.

He includes us in on what he has earned.

To my Father and your Father.

To my God and your God.

Because of the finished work of Christ, we are adopted into the kingdom of God when we put our salvation in Christ.

So we must thank God for salvation.

We must thank God for the finished work.

Because Jesus suffered for us.

What else?

Jesus has prepared a place for us.

And so we can live like our future is secure.

What did Jesus say to the thief on the cross who believed in him?

He said, and truly, truly, I say to you, today, you will be with me in paradise.

Today, you will be with me in paradise.

Our futures are secure since we have put our salvation in Jesus Christ.

Come hell or high water, I am secure in Christ.

I am kept in Christ.

And there is nothing that can take you away from the hand of God.

And so, why are you afraid?

Why are we timid?

Why are we fearful?

Our future is secure.

We are kept in Christ.

That's what he prayed for us before the trial, before the execution, before the crucifixion, before his resurrection.

He says, Father, I have kept them and I will continue to keep them.

We are kept in Christ and so why do you worry?

Why are we so worried about the things in our day to day our future is secure.

He's got the whole world in his hands.

He has prepared a place for us so we can step out in faith. when Kayla and I when we get up in the morning we usually try to pray together before she goes up and gets the kids and so often I found myself saying like give give us the energy and strength for today and then I remembered the Lord's prayer where he says give us today our daily bread and I remember that story all the way back in Exodus where that phrase daily bread comes from and I started changing my wording not because I don't think that Jesus or that God will give us the strength and energy for today I actually do believe that but I also believe he promised that he said give us today our daily bread and so I started changing my prayer to thank you God for the energy and strength for today because if we look at the story all the way back in Exodus we would see how the Lord did provide he gave them exactly what they needed and what happened was some people would take more than what they needed and what would happen it would turn to maggots and so I I just started praying thank you God for giving me the energy and strength that I need for today it's a prayer of faith and trust not a prayer from like a beggar like God please give me the energy and strength I need for today although sometimes I do need to come to the Lord like that but I can also go with confidence and with trust and with obedience and know that he will because he's promised that to me in his word and so I don't know what wording or what phrasing in your mind needs to change for you to walk with a little more confidence that God has given you everything that you need not just for today but for your lifetime because he's promised that because he said he would be with us do not fear for the Lord your God is with you and will be with you wherever you go is the promise he made to Joshua and so what do you what do you need to do what do you need to ask what do you need to pray that God would take that doubt that insecurity that worry and turn it into something different why because Jesus died but he didn't stay that way he got out of the grave and since Jesus resurrected from the dead anything is possible for those who are in Christ and so Jesus suffered for us and so we need to begin to thank him for our salvation thank him for what he has done for us and Jesus has prepared a place for you so you can begin to live like your future is secure and secure not in the things of this world but secure in Jesus in the resurrection of Jesus Jesus suffered for you Jesus has prepared a place for you and so do not store up your things on earth where moths and vermins will come and destroy but store up your things in heaven where your father is Jesus suffered for you and he has prepared a place for you so start living in gratitude and start living in confidence that you are more than a conqueror that your future is secure what else did Jesus promise us in this world you have troubles and so when troubles come don't get worried don't get freaked out no that's part of the plan but go back to God and remember hey Jesus suffered for me thank you Lord for your salvation thank you Lord for all that you've done for me thank you Lord that this world is not my home and the worlds of the lovely Carrie Underwood this is my temporary home this is not where we belong Jesus has prepared a place for us so live like your future is secure would you pray with me this morning father we thank you for your promise we thank you that you suffered for us that you truly did die that you truly were buried and thank you Lord that you did not stay there and that is good news and so Lord we thank you for our salvation that is found in you and you alone that you took the beating for us so that we could be with you and father would you help us not get caught up in the things of this world help us to have a healthy balance of the things of this world but God in allegiance to you and to your kingdom Holy Spirit would you start to speak to us in our own hearts and minds of how that looks for us on a day to day because you have given us everything we need help us to remember our future that is with you forever Lord we need you we love you and we thank you for this morning it's in Jesus name everyone said amen
