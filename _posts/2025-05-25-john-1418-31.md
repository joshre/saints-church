## Transcription

Let's turn in our Bible to John chapter 14.

We're gonna read the whole chapter so we can get reacquainted with the text and then we'll be looking at specifically verses 18 through the end of the chapter but let's read the whole chapter here so we can kind of remember where we were, where we've been, where we're going.

Bueller.

If I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and will take you to myself that where I am you may be also and you know the way to where I'm going Thomas said to him Lord we do not know where you are going how can we know the way Jesus said to him I am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the Father except through me you had known me you would have known my father also from now on you do know him and have seen him said to him Lord show us the father and it is enough for us you said to him have I been with you so long you still do not know me Philip whoever I see me has seen the father how can you say show us the father do you not believe that I am in the father and the father is in me the words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority but the father who dwells in me does his works believe me that I am in the father and the father is in me or else believe on account of the works themselves truly truly I say to you whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do and greater works than needs will he do because I am going to the father wherever you ask in my name this I will do that the father may be glorified in the Sun you asked me anything in my name I will do it if you love me you will keep my commandments and I will ask the father and it will give you another helper to be with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him or knows him you know him for he dwells with you and will be in you I will not leave you as orphans I will come to you get a little while in the world will see me no more you will see me because I live you also will live and that day you will know that I am in the father and you and me and I in you whoever has my commandments and keeps them he did is who loves me and he who loves me will be loved by my father and I will love him and manifest myself to them Judas not asgari it said to him Lord how is it that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world Jesus answered him if anyone loves me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our own with whoever does not love me does not keep my words and the word that you hear is not mine but the father's who sent me these things I spoke to you while I am still with but the helper the Holy Spirit when the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring to you a remembrance all that I've said to you peace I leave with you my peace I give to you not as the world does needs do I give to you let not your hearts be troubled neither let them be afraid you heard me say to you I am going away and I will come to you if you love me you would have rejoice because I'm going to the father for the father is greater than now I have told you before it takes a takes place so that when it does take place you may believe I will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming he has no claim on me but I do as the father has commanded me so that the world may know that I love the father rise let us go from here.

Awesome.

Okay so we'll pick up in verse 18 where Jesus says I will not leave you as orphans I will come to you yet a little while and the world will see me no more but you will see me again Jesus started this passage let not your hearts be troubled believe in God believe also in me that's verse 1 of chapter 14 and when we start to get when we have the context of the verse and even the last couple just the whole scene here Jesus is again he's preparing his disciples for what's next and for what is coming next it is clearly troubling to the disciples it is clearly it's hard to grasp it's hard to understand right like what did Jesus tell him that he's going to prepare a place for them and then he is leaving them but he's coming back and you're leaving us but you're gonna ask the father to send someone to you back to us like and this person is gonna be a helper I can imagine some of the disciples being like why do we need help what what's what's going on who and I'm Jesus said I'm not leaving you as orphans we're orphans now like what's what's going on here it's like when we start to kind of add the list up you can understand why these guys were afraid and even why later on in verse 27 Jesus says my peace I give you right this he's trying to he's hey he's in a very sort of roundabout way but also very straight up going like I'm going to leave you and I'm trying to prepare you for that I know you're not prepared for that I can tell you're troubled I can tell you're worried I can tell you're anxious but I'm when I go I'm gonna send someone else that like a lot going on here for the disciples then in verse 19 it seems like Jesus is going is telling them what's about to come right in the next day or two or three or 40 if you really want to think about it verse 19 yet a little while and the world will see me no more but you will see me because I live you will also live right he's he's speaking of like you're not gonna see me I'm gonna die but then you're gonna see me again I will live and because I live you will live that was kind of hard for them to understand I'm sure we'd be in that same boat verse 20 in that day you will know that I am in you that I am in my father and you and me and I in you let's read that verse again because it's in that day you will know that I am in my father and you and me and I in you so Jesus is speaking of the union of the oneness of the father and the son but notice here he's also inviting his disciples into that communion into that union into that connection with him let's let's talk about this for a moment we have seen this throughout the gospel the relationship between Jesus and God John brings it up all the time he remembers the words of Jesus all the time saying like I am in the father the father is in me whatever the father does I do Jesus says that repeatedly throughout the book of John and we see this this oneness and even in a few chapters Jesus is going to pray to God saying that his disciples would be one like God and Jesus are one that is his desire that that we are united we are in union with him and so if we see this union if we see this togetherness this oneness with the father and the son the question for us for the church not just our church but the church that the bride of Christ if we are to be one with Christ and if my brothers and sisters in Christ are in Christ here's the question how am I treating my fellow brother and sister not your literal brother and sister but your eternal brother and sister how am I treating my fellow brother and sister what does Jesus say he says you will know that I am in my father you and me and I in you what's the picture of the of the togetherness of the oneness that we see with Jesus in the father and he's inviting us into that does that mean we should be keeping a list of wrongs with our brothers and sisters does that mean we should be lording a title a thing over one another does that mean we should be reckless with our words with one another does that mean we should be striking fear or putting a wedge between a brother and sister in Christ should we be doing that I don't think so I am to be one with each of you and yet if I we are more divided as believers as ever before or maybe not as ever before but maybe it seems like that because of how connected we are as a society we can see a lot more I can see into other churches I can hear other pastors and preachers who are teaching heresy I can see those things a little easier and so maybe there's it seems like there's more division why do I bring this up are you am I doing are you doing your part to be one with your brothers and sisters in Christ notice I said your part you cannot control what others do or how they respond but you have responsibility for what you can do to make things right if that's not reciprocated then that's on them but are you doing your part to be one with your brothers and sisters in Christ are you doing your part verse 21 whoever has my commandments and keeps them he it is who loves me and he who loves me will be loved by my father and I will love him and manifest myself to him so Jesus continues on to say if you love me you will obey me this is the second time in this chapter we get this exact sort of verbiage repetition is important let me say it again repetition is important I crack myself up Jesus is telling us that through obedience a person demonstrates that they are truly Christ disciples and love him verse 22 Judas not ascariot said to him Lord how is it that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world and Jesus answered him if anyone loves me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him whoever does not love me does not keep my words and the word that you hear is not mine but the father's who sent me Judas again not ascariot because Judas Ascariot he had already left the scene he speaks up and says Lord how was it that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world and just doesn't Jesus doesn't specifically answer this this question that he has but I do love the question and for like really looking at the text and we're kind of thinking about it from our perspective we could be like okay so now you're gonna ask Jesus this question did you ask Jesus how he turned water into wine did you ask Jesus how he healed a blind man with his spit and dirt did you ask how he healed Lazarus but now at this time you're gonna ask Jesus hey how are you gonna manifest yourself like that just might be too much I've seen you do some pretty cool things Jesus but I'm really questioning this one of course I'm just poking fun but man do I act that way when I feel like I'm up against something or something isn't or something feels impossible and something it feels too hard or too big and I begin to ask man how how was God going to show up like he hasn't shown up for me in the past all right back to the scene at hand Jesus answers him if anyone loves me he will keep my word this is a similar point that Jesus just made right you'll keep my commands but now he just Jesus flips it up a little bit he says would keep his word if anyone loves me he will keep my word and maybe you've encountered a believer before who has said something along the lines of man I I love Jesus but I just can't I can't get down with the Bible like I love Jesus but I just can't I can't get down with the Bible and it's just this bunch of rules and commands and this ancient text what does it really know about us anymore maybe you've encountered somebody like that before and that's one way to look at it but also in response to that person okay you say you love Jesus well Jesus would think differently of the word Jesus would think differently of the scriptures Jesus actually tells us in the scriptures if anyone loves me he will keep my word now we don't know if Jesus means literally his written word but where else do we have the words of Jesus written in the sky on some mushroom trip or these incredibly accurate historical accounts of Jesus so Jesus said if anyone loves me he will keep my word then he added and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him if you love me you love my word and my father will love you because you love me and my word and we are going make our home in you that word in the original language means do a dwelling place in abode it means a home think about that let that sink in for a minute that Jesus just said that he will make his home in you his dwelling place in you the Spirit of God dwells in you what a gift that the Lord has given us the indwelling of the Spirit we brought up this passage last week and from the book of numbers where Moses after he gets after the Spirit of God gets imparted onto these 70 elders and men then Moses says to Joshua I wish the Spirit would go on all of Israel on all of God's people then later in the prophets in the book of Joel we will see a prophecy that the Spirit will come and young men will dream dreams and old men will have visions and what the Spirit is going to do and here is Jesus affirming it saying it's going to happen and indeed my friends it has happened and what confidence and assurance we can have for those of us who confess in Jesus that not only does he save us but he has made his home in us maybe you've gone on a trip before and it's been long and then finally you get home you take your shoes off Jesus has made his home in you Jesus also warns us of the opposite verse 24 whoever does not love me does not keep my words if you love the Lord you keep his word and those who do not love him cannot keep his word and the word that is Jesus's word is also the Father's word then Jesus goes on to say verse 25 these things I have spoken to you while I am still with you but the helper the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you Jesus said that the Spirit would teach all things and bring things back into remembrance for his disciples again Jesus was a rabbi right Jesus was a teacher and he told his disciples to follow him and in following him they would hear all these stories all these parables that Jesus would tell and Jesus promised these men here in this upper room that the Spirit would help them recall these stories and then what would they later do they would document these stories and give us what we now have as the Gospels and we can believe that these accounts are not just luck or happenstance but that the Spirit empower these Apostles to record the works of Jesus what an incredible gift these scriptures are to us verse 27 peace I leave with you my peace I give to you not as the world gives do I give to you when Jesus says peace I leave with you what kind of peace do you think he's referring to now as we have discussed before Jesus is going to use this word world right Jesus says not as the world gives do I give to you and as we discussed this this word the world Jesus making a distinction between his disciples and non disciples his his followers and not his followers his believers and non-believers so we need to keep that into account we also need to keep into account before we answer this question what kind of peace is is Jesus referring to we also need to keep into account the higher purpose and the higher purpose for Jesus is coming to earth right John 3 16 forgots of the world that gives only son whoever will believe in him would not perish but have eternal life that we would not perish that we would not die but that we would have eternal life Paul would say it this way Romans 5 1 therefore since we have been justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Christ Jesus we have peace with God through Jesus this is what Christ came to do to leave us peace to give us peace Jesus was and is at peace with the Father his disciples were not the world was not so they are again in this upper room before Jesus takes up the cross and he's starting to tell them what's going on what they are preparing Jesus says to them is peace I leave with you my peace he says his peace with the Father is what he gives to them and with those who believe in Jesus what we get is peace with the Father how beautiful is that not as the world gives what does the world give the world gives us war the world gives us death what is Jesus even say later the ruler of this world right that's in verse 30 31 yeah 30 for the ruler of this world is coming he's talking about Satan the enemy the devil whatever you want to call him that's the ruler of the world and so the world gives us death the world gives us we become an enemy of God through our sin until we come to a saving faith in Christ then we are justified not by our works but by our faith and the perfect one but by our faith in Jesus we accept his death on our behalf and we receive his peace that he has given us praise Jesus God is so good to us that he has given us his peace we would be so we would be so lost without that literally metaphorically every way would we would be lost without the peace of Jesus his peace that he has given to us by taking up the cross so Jesus says to his men in this room to his disciples in this room peace I leave with you my peace I give to you not just a temporal peace not just a a a piece that the all the bills are paid not just a piece of good health not just a piece of today peace I leave with you my peace I give to you not as the world gives do I give to you so let not your hearts be troubled and neither let them be afraid 28 you heard me say to you I am going away and I will come to you if you love me you would have rejoiced because I'm going to the father for the father is greater than I and now I have told you before it takes place so that when it does take place you may believe I'm telling you now so when this does happen you don't have to question it you can the bank he called his shot eight ball corner pocket called his shot I will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming he has no claim on me but I do as the father has commanded me so that the world may know that I love the father rise let us go from here Jesus is telling his disciples these things so that they will believe he is who he says he is and does what he says he will do he also gives them the advance that the enemy is coming for Jesus but the enemy has no claim over Jesus Jesus is on a mission from the father and will accomplish what the father has laid out before him and here we are in 2025 talking about that mission and accomplishment all these years later why because the peace Jesus gave his disciples was not just for them in that room Jesus's peace is for all who would believe and this morning my brothers and sisters let us leave this place with the assurance of peace that he has covered all of our sin and shame and that we are justified through him and that it is his peace that he leaves with us his peace that he gives us and his peace that we can say just as the enemy had no claim over him he has no claim over us we are victors we are victorious not through our works or not through anything of our own accord but because Jesus conquered that's why and he has given us his peace and it's not by our works so that no man can boast he gives it to us his peace he leaves with us would you pray with me Jesus we thank you that you are the giver of peace we thank you Jesus that you are the prince of peace that's what you came to accomplish and that's what you came to give us was to fix our mistakes and not just fix them but make it even ten times a million times better we're sorry God for not keeping your word but we thank you for your son who did and it is through him that you see us help us as we go to be filled with your peace because we have it because you have given it to us we thank you Jesus for the comfort and assurance that your peace gives us help us to not question that help us to hold on to it help us to hold on to what you've given us we love you Jesus we praise you and we thank you it's in your name everyone said amen
