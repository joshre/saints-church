## Transcription

Let's turn in our Bible to John chapter 14.

We're going to read the whole chapter so we can get reacquainted with the text.

And then we'll be looking at specifically verses 18 through the end of the chapter.

But let's read the whole chapter here so we can kind of remember where we were, where we've been, and where we're going.

Bueller.

I can read.

Let not your hearts be troubled.

Believe in God.

Believe also in me.

In my Father's house are many rooms.

It were not so, but I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you.

If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself.

That where I am, you may be also.

And you know the way to where I am going.

Thomas said to him, Lord, we do not know where you are going.

How can we know the way?

Jesus said to him, I am the way and the truth and the life.

No one comes to the Father except through me.

If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.

From now on you do know him and have seen him.

Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father and it is enough for us.

Jesus said to him, have I been with you so long and you still do not know me, Philip?

Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.

How can you say, show us the Father?

Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?

The words that I say to you, I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works.

Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves.

Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do, and greater works than needs will he do, because I am going to the Father.

Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.

If you love me, you will keep my commandments, and I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him or knows him.

You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.

I will not leave you as orphans, I will come to you.

Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more, but you will see me.

Because I live, you also will live.

In that day you will know that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you.

Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me.

And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.

Judas, not Iscariot, said to him, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world?

Jesus answered him, If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our own with him.

Whoever does not love me does not keep my words, and the word that you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.

These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you, but the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to you in remembrance all that I have said to you.

Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you.

Not as the world does, gives due I give to you.

Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.

You heard me say to you, I am going away, and I will come to you.

If you love me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.

And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place, you may believe.

I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming.

He has no claim on me, but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father.

Rise, let us go from here.

Awesome.

Okay, so we'll pick up in verse 18, where Jesus says, I will not leave you as orphans, I will come to you yet a little while, and the world will see me no more, but you will see me.

Again, Jesus started this passage, Let not your hearts be troubled, believe in God, believe also in me.

That's verse 1 of chapter 14.

And when we start to get, when we have the context of the verse, and even the last couple, just the whole scene here, Jesus is, again, he's preparing his disciples for what's next, and for what is coming next.

It is clearly troubling to the disciples, it is clearly, it's hard to grasp, it's hard to understand, right?

Like, what did Jesus tell him?

That he's going to prepare a place for them?

And then he's leaving them, but he's coming back?

Like, and you're leaving us, but you're going to ask the Father to send someone to you, back to us?

Like, and this person's going to be a helper?

I can imagine some of the disciples being like, why do we need help?

What, what's, what's going on?

Like, who, and I'm, Jesus said, I'm not leaving you as orphans?

We're, we're orphans now?

Like, what's, what's going on here?

It's like, when we start to kind of add the list up, you can understand why these guys were afraid, and even why later on in verse 27, Jesus says, my peace I give you, right?

Like, this, he's trying to, he's, hey, he's in a very sort of roundabout way, but also very straight up going like, I'm going to leave you, and I'm trying to prepare you for that.

I know you're not prepared for that.

I can tell you're troubled.

I can tell you're worried.

I can tell you're anxious.

But I'm, when I go, I'm going to send someone else.

That, like, a lot going on here for the disciples.

Then in verse 19, it seems like Jesus is going, is telling them what's about to come, right?

In the next day or two or three or 40, if you really want to think about it.

Verse 19, yet a little while, and the world will see me no more, but you will see me.

Because I live, you will also live.

Right?

He's, he's speaking of, like, you're not going to see me.

I'm going to die.

But then you're going to see me again.

I, I will live.

And because I live, you will live.

That was kind of hard for them to understand.

I'm sure we'd be in that same boat.

Verse 20.

In that day, you will know that I am in you, that I am in my father, and you in me, and I in you.

So, let's read that verse again, because it's, in that day, you will know that I am in my father, and you in me, and I in you.

So, Jesus is speaking of the union, of the oneness of the father and the son.

But notice here, he's also inviting his disciples into that communion, into that union, into that connection with him.

Let's, let's talk about this for a moment.

We have seen this throughout the gospel, the relationship between Jesus and God.

John brings it up all the time.

He remembers the words of Jesus all the time.

Saying, like, I am in the father, the father is in me.

Whatever the father does, I do.

Jesus says that repeatedly throughout the book of John.

And, we see this, this oneness.

And even in a few chapters, Jesus, Jesus is going to pray to God.

Saying that, uh, his disciples would be one.

Like, God and Jesus are one.

That is his desire, that, that we are united.

We are in union with him.

And so, if we see this union.

If we see this togetherness, this oneness with the father and the son.

The question for us.

For the church.

Not just our church, but the church.

The bride of Christ.

If we are to be one with Christ.

And if my brothers and sisters in Christ.

Are in Christ.

Here's the question.

How am I treating my fellow brother and sister?

Not your literal brother and sister.

But your eternal brother and sister.

How am I treating my fellow brother and sister?

What does Jesus say?

He says.

You will know that I am in my father.

You in me.

And I in you.

What's the picture of the, of the togetherness.

Of the oneness that we see with Jesus and the father.

And he's inviting us into that.

Does that mean we should be keeping a list of wrongs with our brothers and sisters?

Does that mean we should be lording a, a, a, a title?

A, a, a thing over one another?

Does that mean we should be reckless with our words with one another?

Does that mean we should be, uh, striking fear?

Or, uh, putting a wedge between a brother and sister in Christ?

Should we be doing that?

I don't think so.

I am to be one with each of you.

And yet, if I look at our world today, we are more divided as believers as ever before.

Or maybe not as ever before, but maybe it seems like that because of how connected we are as a society.

We can see a lot more.

I can see into other churches.

I can hear other pastors and preachers who are teaching heresy.

Maybe, I can see those things a little easier.

And so maybe there's, it seems like there's more division.

Why do I bring this up?

Are you, am I, doing, are you doing your part to be one with your brothers and sisters in Christ?

Notice I said, your part.

You cannot control what others do or how they respond.

But you have responsibility for what you can do to make things right.

If that's not reciprocated, then that's on them.

But are you doing your part to be one with your brothers and sisters in Christ?

Are you doing your part?

Verse 21, whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he, it is who loves me.

And he who loves me will be loved by my father and I will love him and manifest myself to him.

So Jesus continues on to say, if you love me, you will obey me.

This is the second time in this chapter, we get this exact sort of verbiage.

Repetition is important.

Let me say it again.

Repetition is important.

I cracked myself up.

Jesus is telling us that through obedience, a person demonstrates that they are truly Christ's disciples and love him.

Verse 22, Judas, not Iscariot, said to him, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world?

Jesus answered him, if anyone loves me, he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him.

Whoever does not love me does not keep my words.

And the word that you hear is not mine, but the father's who sent me.

Judas, again, not Iscariot.

Because Judas Iscariot, he had already left the scene.

He speaks up and says, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world?

And doesn't Jesus doesn't specifically answer this this question that he has.

But I do love the question.

And if we're like really looking at the text and we're kind of thinking about it from our perspective, we could be like, okay, so now you're going to ask Jesus this question.

Did you ask Jesus how he turned water into wine?

Did you ask Jesus how he healed a blind man with his spit and dirt?

Did you ask how he healed Lazarus?

But now, at this time, you're going to ask Jesus, hey, how are you going to manifest yourself?

Like, that just might be too much.

I've seen you do some pretty cool things, Jesus, but I'm really questioning this one.

Of course, I'm just poking fun, but man, do I act that way when I feel like I'm up against something or something isn't or something feels impossible and something feels too hard or too big.

And I begin to ask, man, how is God going to show up like he hasn't shown up for me in the past?

All right, back to the scene at the end.

Jesus answers him.

If anyone loves me, he will keep my word.

This is a similar point that Jesus just made, right?

You'll keep my commands.

But now he just, Jesus flips it up a little bit.

He says, would keep his word.

If anyone loves me, he will keep my word.

And maybe you've encountered a believer before who has said something along the lines of, man, I love Jesus, but I just can't, I can't get down with the Bible.

And it's just this bunch of rules and commands and this ancient text.

What does it really know about us anymore?

Maybe you've encountered somebody like that before.

And that's one way to look at it.

But also, in response to that person, okay, you say you love Jesus.

Well, Jesus would think differently of the word.

Jesus would think differently of the scriptures.

Jesus actually tells us in the scriptures, if anyone loves me, he will keep my word.

Now, we don't know if Jesus means literally his written word.

But where else do we have the words of Jesus written in the sky on some mushroom trip or these incredibly accurate historical accounts of Jesus?

So Jesus said, if anyone loves me, he will keep my word.

Then he added, and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him.

If you love me, you love my word.

And my father will love you because you love me and my word.

And we are going to make our home in you.

That word in the original language means a dwelling place.

An abode.

It means a home.

Think about that.

Let that sink in for a minute.

That Jesus just said.

That he will make his home in you.

His dwelling place in you.

The spirit of God dwells in you.

What a gift that the Lord has given us.

The indwelling of the spirit.

We brought up this passage last week and from the book of Numbers where Moses.

After he gets.

After the spirit of God gets imparted onto these 70 elders and men.

Then.

Moses.

Says to Joshua.

I wish the spirit would go.

Go on all of Israel.

On all of God's people.

Then later.

In the prophets.

In the book of Joel.

We will see.

A prophecy.

That the spirit will come.

And young men will.

Dream dreams.

And old men will have visions.

And.

What the spirit is going to do.

And here is.

Jesus.

Affirming it.

Saying it's.

Going to happen.

And indeed my friends.

It has.

Happened.

And what confidence.

And assurance.

We can have for those of us who confess.

In Jesus.

That not only does he save us.

But he has made his home.

In us.

Maybe you've gone on a trip before.

And it's been.

Long.

And then finally you get home.

You take your shoes off.

Ah.

Ah.

Ah.

Ah.

Ah.

Jesus has made his home.

In you.

Jesus also.

Warns us of the opposite.

Verse 24.

Whoever does not love me.

Does not keep my words.

If you love the Lord.

You keep his word.

And those who do not love him.

Cannot keep his word.

And the word.

That is Jesus's word.

Is also.

The father's word.

Then Jesus goes on to say.

Verse 25.

These things I have spoken to you.

While I am still with you.

But the helper.

The holy spirit.

Whom the father will send.

In my name.

He will teach you all things.

And bring to your remembrance.

All that I have said to you.

Jesus said.

That the spirit would teach all things.

And bring things back into remembrance.

For his disciples.

Again.

Jesus was.

A rabbi.

Right?

Jesus was a teacher.

And he told his disciples.

To follow him.

And in following him.

They would hear all these stories.

All these parables.

That Jesus would tell.

And Jesus promised.

These men.

Here in this upper room.

That the spirit would help them.

Recall these stories.

And then what would they later do?

They would document these stories.

And give us what we now have.

As the gospel.

And we can believe.

That these accounts.

Are not just luck.

Or happenstance.

But that the spirit.

Empowered these apostles.

To record.

The works.

Of Jesus.

What an incredible gift.

These scriptures are to us.

Verse 27.

Peace I leave with you.

My peace I give to you.

Not as the world gives.

Do I give to you.

When Jesus says peace I leave with you.

What kind of peace do you think he's referring to?

Now as we have discussed before.

Jesus is going to use this word world.

Right?

Jesus says not as the world gives.

Do I give to you?

And as we discussed this word.

The world.

Jesus is making a distinction between his disciples and non-disciples.

His followers and not his followers.

His believers and non-believers.

So we need to keep that into account.

We also need to keep into account.

Before we answer this question.

What kind of peace is Jesus referring to?

We also need to keep into account.

The higher purpose.

And the higher purpose for Jesus is coming to earth.

Right?

John 3.16.

For God sold the world.

He gave his only son.

Whoever would believe in him would not perish.

But have eternal life.

That we would not perish.

That we would not die.

But that we would have eternal life.

Paul would say it this way.

Romans 5.1.

Therefore since we have been justified by faith.

We have peace with God through our Lord Christ Jesus.

We have peace with God through Jesus.

This is what Christ came to do.

To leave us peace.

To give us peace.

Jesus was and is at peace with the Father.

His disciples were not.

The world was not.

So they are again in this upper room.

Before Jesus takes up the cross.

And he's starting to tell them what's going on.

What they are preparing for.

And what Jesus says to them is.

Peace I leave with you.

My peace.

He says.

His peace with the Father is what he gives to them.

And with those who believe in Jesus.

What we get is peace with the Father.

How beautiful is that?

Not as the world gives.

What does the world give?

The world gives us war.

The world gives us death.

What does Jesus even say later?

The ruler of this world.

Right?

That's in verse 30. 31.

Yeah. 30.

For the ruler of this world is coming.

He's talking about Satan.

The enemy.

The devil.

Whatever you want to call him.

That's the ruler of the world.

And so the world.

Gives us death.

The world gives us.

We become an enemy of God.

Through our sin.

Until we come to a saving faith in Christ.

Then we are justified.

Not by our works.

But by our faith.

In the perfect one.

But by our faith in Jesus.

We accept his death on our behalf.

And we receive his peace.

That he has given us.

Praise.

Jesus.

God is so good to us.

That he has given us his peace.

We would be.

So lost without that.

Literally.

Metaphorically.

Every way.

We would be lost.

Without.

The peace.

Of Jesus.

His peace.

That he has given to us.

By taking up.

The cross.

So Jesus says.

To his.

Men.

In this room.

To his.

Disciples in this room.

Peace.

I leave with you.

My peace.

I give to you.

Not just a temporal peace.

Not just a.

A.

A peace.

That the.

All the bills are paid.

Not just a peace.

Of good health.

Not just a peace of.

Today.

Peace.

I leave with you.

My peace.

I give to you.

Not as the world gives.

Do I give to you.

So let not your hearts be troubled.

And neither let them be afraid. 28.

You heard me say to you.

I am going away.

And I will come to you.

If you love me.

You would have rejoiced.

Because I am going to the father.

For the father is greater than I.

And now I have told you.

Before it takes place.

So that when it does.

Take place.

You may believe.

I'm telling you now.

So when this does happen.

You don't have to question it.

You can take it to the bank.

He called his shot.

He called his shot.

Eight ball.

Corner pocket.

Called his shot.

I will no longer talk much with you.

For the ruler of this world is coming.

He has no claim on me.

But I do as the father has commanded me.

So that the world.

May know.

That I love the father.

Rise.

Let us go from here.

Jesus is telling his disciples.

These things.

So that they will believe.

He is.

Who he says he is.

And does what he says.

He will do.

He also gives them the advance.

That the enemy is coming.

For Jesus.

But the enemy has no claim.

Over Jesus.

Jesus is on a mission.

From the father.

And will accomplish.

What the father has laid out.

Before him.

And here we are.

In 2025.

Talking about that mission.

And accomplishment.

All these years later.

Why?

Because the peace.

Jesus gave.

His disciples.

Was not just for them.

In that room.

Jesus is peace.

Is for all who would believe.

And this morning.

My brothers and sisters.

Let us leave this place.

With the assurance of peace.

That he has covered.

All of our sin.

And shame.

And that we are justified.

Through him.

And that it is his peace.

That he leaves with us.

His peace.

That he gives us.

And his peace.

That we can say.

Just as the enemy.

Had no claim over him.

He has no claim over us.

We are victors.

We are.

Victorious.

Not through our works.

Or not through anything.

Of our own accord.

But because.

Jesus.

Conquered.

That's why.

And he has given us his peace.

And it's not by our works.

So that no man can boast.

He gives it to us.

His peace.

He leaves.

With us.

Would you pray with me?

Jesus.

We thank you.

That you.

Are the giver.

Of peace.

We thank you Jesus.

That you are the prince.

Of peace.

Peace.

That's what you came to accomplish.

And that's what you came to give us.

Was to fix our mistakes.

And not just fix them.

But.

Make it even ten times.

A million times better.

We're sorry God.

For not keeping your word.

But we thank you for your son.

Who did.

And it is through him.

That you see us.

Help us as we go.

To be filled.

With your peace.

Because we have it.

Because you have given it to us.

We thank you Jesus.

For the comfort.

And assurance.

That your peace gives us.

Help us to not question that.

Help us to hold on to it.

Help us to hold on to what you've given us.

We love you Jesus.

We praise you and we thank you.

And it's in your name.

Everyone said.

Amen.

Amen.
